## PREFACE

The  Indian  agriculture  has  taken  a  paradigm  shift  from  conventional  farming  to precision agriculture with an intend to overcome a bundle of constraints such as shrinking arable lands, frequent droughts, declining organic matter, multi-nutrient deficiencies besides exodus of  people  from  farming.  Despite  the  fact  that  the  country  faces  extreme  weather conditions, the State of Tamil Nadu retained its glory by getting the Krishi Karman Award 2019 for  the  fifth  time  in  a  row  for  continued  enhancement  of  food  grain  and  oilseed production.  The  data  vividly  indicate  the  successful  accomplishments  of  both  scientists  of TNAU and officials in the Department of Agriculture in the past several years.

The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore, is playing a pivotal role in design and development of crop varieties, technologies and farm implements to suit the prevailing situations and adapt to the climate change scenarios. In this context, there was an urgent need for standard operational protocols and technology package of practices to fit various agro-climatic zones of the state of Tamil Nadu. In this context, the TNAU under the dynamic leadership  of  the  Vice  Chancellor,  Director  of  Research  and  other  technical  directors,  the ' Crop  Production  Guide  (CPG)  -  Agriculture  2020 '  was  revised,  updated  and  put together as a technology capsule prescribed for adoption by the Department of Agriculture and in turn to the farmers of the State. While doing the revision, the Director of Agriculture and entire team of Department officials ensured that the field level problems are addressed.

The CPG - Agriculture  2020 carries  recommended  crops  and  varieties,  seed  to seed crop management technologies, seed invigoration techniques, soil-test crop response based  fertilizer prescription, drip fertigation, integrated weed  management  practices, technology capsule for pests and diseases management, labour saving farm machineries and post-harvest management practices.

I  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  and  the  Vice  Chancellor,  Director  of  Agriculture, Director of Research, other Technical Directors and Department officials for their assiduous efforts to orchestrate the document that serve as the base for the agricultural growth and development in the State of Tamil Nadu.

## PREFACE

The  Tamil  Nadu  Agricultural  University,  Coimbatore,  is  one  of  the  best  State Agricultural  Universities  in  the  country,  evolving  several  crop  varieties,  technologies  and farm implements to promote productivity and profitability of farms while ensuring environmental safety and rural livelihood. The TNAU has a well articulated and structured research framework to develop varieties and technologies to enable adoption by the farmers of the State.

The Research Council  of  TNAU  identifies  the  field  problems  that  are  developed  as research projects, monitored and evaluated during the annual crop scientists meets and the research outcomes are presented to the State level Scientific Workers Conference to take the final decision on the varieties or technologies to be recommended for adoption. Such a meticulous planning and execution help us in assembling basket of varieties and technologies that are packaged as the Crop Production Guide.

The  TNAU  has  taken  efforts  to  revise  and  update  the  ' Crop  Production  Guide (CPG) - Agriculture 2020 '  involving  the  Directors  and  Deans  in  the  university  besides Department of Agriculture and Department officials. In the past one year, there was a close coordination between the Department and University in undertaking joint efforts to resolve the unresolved field problems. Such network helped us to improve the CPG as a technology package suitable for the farmers of the Tamil Nadu State. The CPG carries recommended crop varieties, improved management technologies, precision farming practices, technology capsule  for  the  management  of  pests  and  diseases  besides  post-harvest  management practices.

I take this opportunity to thank the Agricultural Production Commissioner &amp; Principal Secretary to the Government, Director of Agriculture, Director of Research, other Technical Directors, Deans and Department officials for their contribution towards the publication of the CPG - Agriculture 2020.

Note of Caution of the varieties :  ADT43 is recommended  for Kar,  Sornavari  and  Kuruvai seasons and should not be grown during cold weather period. Improved  white ponni   is also susceptible to blast and care should be taken on plant protection measures. All samba/late samba season varieties are likely to get infected with false smut and hence prophylactic spraying has to beadopted.

Kuruvai/Navarai/Sornavari : Short duration

late samba/thaladi : Medium duration

Samba : long duration

## CROP MANAGEMENTSYSTEMS OF RICE CULTIVATION IN TAMIL NADU

Rice  is  cultivated  under puddled and un-puddled  lowland situations  in  Tamil Nadu. 'Transplanting' and 'direct wet seeding' are the two environments under puddled lowland.  Whereas,  un-puddled  lowland  cultivation  undergoes  different  environments like, dry seeding exclusively with rainfall, locally called as 'rainfed rice', with supplemental  irrigation  during  peak  vegetative  and  reproductive  phases  by  the  rain water collected / harvested in tanks ('semi-dry rice') and also assured irrigation from canal after 30-45 days of dry situation (also called semi-dry rice) . They are grouped as follows:

## 1. Transplanted puddled lowland rice

## 2. Direct seeded lowland  rice

- a. Wet seeded rice in puddled  soil
- b. Dry seeded rice in un-puddled  soil
- i) Rainfed
- ii) Semi dry - supplemental  irrigation
- iii) Semi dry - canal irrigation* (contingent crop)
- 3. Dry seeded upland rice - This system of rice cultivation is there in areas with high rainfall (like Assam and NE frontiers of India) where the land is slopy and terraced and there is no possibility for bunding to stagnate the water. Grain yield is poor due to loss of nutrients and soil mainly caused by water erosion. Moisture  availability  is  mostly  at  saturation  or  at  wet  range.  There  is  very limited area in Dharmapuri district, Tamil  Nadu .
- 4. Deep water rice cultivation exists in  certain  pockets    of    Nagapattinam    and Tiruvarur  districts particularly during NE monsoon with heavy downpour.

## 1. TRANSPLANTED PUDDLED LOWLAND RICE

## TRANSPLANTED RICE

## 1.1 Nursery management

## 1.1.1. Wet  nursery Nursery area

Select 20 cents (800 m ) of land area near to water source for raising seedlings 2 for one hectare.

## Seed rate

- 30 kg for long duration
- 40 kg for medium duration
- 60 kg for short duration varieties and 20 kg for hybrids

## Seed treatment

- a. Treat the seeds in Carbendazim or Pyroquilon  or Tricyclozole  solution  at 2 g/l of water  for 1  kg of seeds. Soak the seeds in water for 10 hrs and drain excess water.
- b. This wet seed treatment gives protection to the seedlings up  to  40  days  from seedling  disease such  as  blast and  this  method  is  better than  dry  seed treatment.
- c. If the seeds are required for sowing immediately, keep the soaked seed in gunny in dark and cover with extra gunnies and leave for 24hrs for sprouting.
- d. Seed  treatment  with Pseudomonas  fluorescens :  Treat  the  seeds    with    talc based formulation of Pseudomonas fluorescens 10g/kg of seed and soak in 1lit of water  overnight.  Decant  the  excess  water  and  allow  the  seeds  to  sprout  for 24hrs and then sow.
- e. Seed treatment with biofertilizers : Five packets (1kg/ha) each of Azospirillum and  Phosphobacteria  or  five  packets  (1kg/ha)  of  Azophos  bioinoculants  are mixed  with  sufficient  water  wherein  the  seeds  are  soaked  overnight  before sowing in the nursery  bed  (The  bacterial suspension after decanting may be poured over the nursery area itself).

Carrier  based  formulation:  Treat  one  hectare  of  seeds  with  1  kg  each  of biofertilizers viz., Azsopirillum, Phosphobacteria, (or) Azophos, Silicate solubilizing bacteria (SSB) / Potash bacteria (KRB) using rice gruel,  shade dry for 30 minutes before sowing.

Liquid formulation : Treat one hectare of seeds with 125 ml of each biofertilizers viz., Azsopirillum, Phosphobacteria  (or)  Azophos,  Silicate  solubilizing  bacteria (SSB) / Potash bacteria (KRB) shade dry for 30 minutes before sowing.

- · Biocontrol agents are compatible with biofertilizers
- · Biofertilizers and biocontrol agents can be mixed together for seed soaking
- · Fungicides and biocontrol agents are incompatible

## Forming Seedbeds

- · Mark plots of 2.5m breadth with channels 30cm wide all around the seedbeds.
- · Length  of the seed bed may vary from 8 to 10m according to soil and slope of the land.
- · Collect the puddled soil from the channel and spread on the seedbeds or drag a heavy stone along the channel  to lower  it, so that the seed bed is at a higher level.
- · Level the surface of the seedbed, so that the water drains into the channel.

## Sowing

- · Sow the sprouted seeds uniformly on the seedbed having thin film of water in the surface.

## Water Management

- · Drain the water 18 to 24 hrs after sowing
- · Care must be taken to avoid stagnation of water on the  seedbed.
- · Allow  enough  water  to  saturate    the  soil  from  3 rd to  5 th day.  From  5 th day onwards,  increase  the water depth to 1.5 cm depending on the height of the seedlings.
- · Thereafter maintain 2.5 cm depth of water.

## Weed Management

- · Apply any one of the pre-emergence herbicides viz .,  Pyrazosulfuron ethyl @ 20 g/ha on 3 rd or 4 th day after sowing to control weeds in the lowland nursery. Keep a thin film of water  and allow it to disappear. Avoid drainage of water. This will control germinating weeds.
- · Pre-emergence herbicide Butachlor 1.0 l/ha (or) Pendimethalin 1.0 l/ha. Herbicides should be applied on 8 DAS with thin layer of water in the field.

## Nutrient management

- · Apply 1 tonne of fully decomposed FYM or compost to 20 cents nursery and spread the manure uniformly on dry  soil.
- · Basal application of DAP is recommended when the seedlings are to be pulled out in 20-25 days after sowing in less fertile nursery soils.
- · For that situation, before the last puddling, apply 40 kg of DAP and if not readily available, apply straight fertilizers 16 kg of urea and 120 kg of super phosphate.
- · If seedlings are to be pulled out after 25 days, application  of DAP is to be done 10 days  prior to pulling out.
- · For clayey soils where root snapping is a problem, 4 kg of gypsum and 1 kg of DAP/cent can be applied at 10 days after  sowing.
- · Soil application of 100 g ZnSO4 /cent can be followed.

## 1.1.2. Dry nursery

- · Dry ploughed field with fine tilth is required.
- · Nursery area with sand and loamy soil status is more suitable for this type of nursery.

- · Area 20 cents.
- · Plots of 1 to 1.5 m width of beds and channels may be formed. Length may be according to the slope and soil. Raised beds are more ideal if the soil is clayey in nature.
- · Seed rate and seed treatment as that of wet nursery.
- · Sowing may be dry seeding. Seeds may be covered with sand and finely powdered well decomposed farm yard manure.
- · Irrigation may be done to wet the soil to saturation.
- · Optimum age for transplanting - 4 th leaf stage
- · This type of nursery is handy in times of delayed receipt of canal water.
- · During transplanting seedlings may be dipped in 2% ZnSO4 or ZnO for 30 min and then transplanted.

## 1.2. Main Field Management

## 1.2.1. Land preparation

- · Plough the land during summer to economize the water requirement for initial preparation of land.
- · Flood the field 1 or 2 days before ploughing and allow water to soak in. Keep the surface  of  the field covered with  water.
- · Keep water to a depth of 2.5cm at the time of puddling.
- · Special technologies for problem soils:
- a) For fluffy paddy soils: compact the soil by passing 400kg stone roller  or oildrum    with  stones  inside,  eight  times  at  proper  moisture    level  (moisture level at friable condition  of  soil which is approximately 13 to18%) once in three years, to prevent  the  sinking  of draught animals and workers during puddling.
- b) For  sodic  soils  with  pH  values  of  more  than  8.5,  plough    at  optimum moisture    regime,    apply  gypsum  at  50%  gypsum  requirement  uniformly, impound  water,  provide  drainage for leaching out soluble salts and apply green leaf manure at 5 t/ha, 10 to 15 days before transplanting. Mix 37.5 kg of  zinc  sulphate  per  ha  with  sand  to  make  a  total  quantity  of  75    kg  and spread  the  mixture  uniformly  on  the  leveled  field.  Do  not  incorporate  the mixture in the soil. Rice under sodic soil responds well to these practices.
- c) For saline soils with EC values of more than 4 dS/m, provide lateral and main drainage channels (60cm deep and 45cm wide), apply green leaf manure at 5 t/ha at 10 to 15 days before transplanting and 25% extra dose of nitrogen in addition to recommended P and  K and ZnSO4
- d) For acid soils apply lime based on the soil analysis  for obtaining  normal  rice yields.  Lime is applied 2.5 t/ha before last ploughing. Apply lime at this rate to each crop up to the 5 th crop.

## 1.2.2.Stand Establishment

## Optimum age of seedlings for quick establishment

- · Optimum age of the seedlings is 18-22 days for short, 25-30  days  for  medium and  35-40  days for long duration  varieties.

## Pulling out the seedlings

- · Pull out the seedlings at the appropriate time (4 th leaf  stage).
- · Pulling at 3 rd leaf stage is also possible. These seedlings can produce more tillers, provided  enough  care  taken  during  the  establishment  phase  (See  section  1.8 Integrated  Crop  Management  (ICM)  -  Rice-SRI)  through  thin  film  of  water management and perfect leveling of main field.
- · Transplanting after 5 th and higher order leaf numbers will affect the performance    of  the  crop    and  grain  yield.  Then  they  are  called  as  'aged seedlings'.  Special  package  is  needed    to  minimize  the  grain  yield  loss  while planting those aged seedlings.

## Root dipping

- · Prepare the slurry with 5 packets (1 kg/ha) each of Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria or 5 packets of (1 kg/ha) Azophos inoculant in 40 lit. of water and  dip  the  root  portion  of  the    seedlings  for  15  -  30  minutes  in  bacterial suspension and transplant.

## Planting seedlings in the main field

| Soil                         | Medium and low fertility   | Medium and low fertility   | Medium and low fertility   | High fertility   | High fertility   | High fertility   |

| Duration                     | Short                      | Medium                     | Long                       | Short            | Medium           | Long             |
| Spacing (cm) Hills   / m   2 | 15x10  66                  | 20x10  50                  | 20x15 33                   | 20x10 50         | 20x15  33        | 20x20  25        |

- · Transplant 2-3 seedlings/hill for short duration and 2 seedlings/hill for medium and long duration varieties
- · Shallow planting (3 cm) ensures quick establishment and more  tillers.
- · Deeper planting (&gt; 5cm) leads to delayed establishment and reduced tillers.
- · Line planting permits rotary weeding and its associated  benefits.
- · Allow a minimum row spacing of 20 cm to use rotary weeder.
- · Fill up the gaps between 7 th and 10 th DAT.

## Management of Aged seedlings*

- * Which developed tillers / underwent node elongation in the nursery itself and About half of its leaf producing capacity may be already  over.
- · Follow the spacing recommended to medium and low fertility  soil
- · Plant two to three seedlings per hill
- · Avoid cluster planting of aged seedlings, which are hindering the formation  of new tillers.
- · New  tillers  alone  are  capable  of  producing  normal  harvestable  panicle.  Weak panicle may appear in the mother culm within three weeks after transplanting and vanishes well before harvest.
- · To encourage the tiller production, enhance the basal N application by 50% from the recommended and thereafter follow the normal schedule recommended for other  stages.

## Gap filling

- · Fill  the  gaps  if  any  within  7  -  10  days  after  planting.Nutrient  management Application of organic manures
- · Apply 12.5 t of FYM or compost or green leaf manure @ 6.25 t/ha.

- · If green manure is raised @ 50 kg seeds/ha in situ, incorporate it to a depth of 15 cm using a green manure trampler or tractor.
- · In the place of green manure, press-mud / composted coir-pith can also be used.

## 1.2.3. Nutrient Management

## Stubble incorporation

- · Apply 10 kg N/ha (22 kg urea) at the time of first puddling while incorporating the  stubbles  of  previous  crop  to  compensate  immobilization  of  N  by  the stubbles.
- · This may be done at least 10 days prior  to  planting  of  subsequent  crop.  This recommendation is more suitable for double crop wetlands, wherein, the second crop is transplanted in succession with short turn around period.

## Biofertilizer application

- · Broadcast 10 kg of soil based powdered BGA flakes at 10 DAT for the dry season crop. Maintain a thin film of water for multiplication.
- · Raise  Azolla  as  a  dual  crop  by  inoculating  250  kg/ha  3  to  5  DAT  and  then incorporate during weeding for the wet season  crop.
- · Mix 2 kg each of biofertilizers viz., Azsopirillum, Phosphobacteria (or) Azophos, Silicate solubilizing bacteria (SSB) / Potash bacteria (KRB) with 25 kg of FYM and 25 kg of sand and broad cast uniformly before transplanting and
- · Pseudomonas fluorescens (Pf 1) at 2.5 kg/ha mixed with 50 kg FYM and 25 kg of soil and broadcast the mixture uniformly before transplanting.

## Application of inorganic fertilizers

- · Apply   fertilizer   nutrients as per STCR-IPNS recommendations for desired yield target (Appendix I) (or)
- · N dose may be through Leaf Color Chart ( LCC )*
- · P  &amp;  K  may  be  through  Site  Specific  Nutrition  Management  by  Omission  plot technique**
- · If the  above  recommendation  are  not  able  to  be  followed,  adopt  blanket recommendation a follows:

## N management through LCC

- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Time of application is decided by LCC score
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Take observations from 14 DAT in transplanted rice or 21 DAS in direct seeded rice.
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Repeat the observations at weekly intervals up to heading
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Observe the leaf colour in the fully opened third leaf from the top as index leaf.
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Match the leaf color  with the colours  in the chart during morning  hours (8-10 am).
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Take observation in 10 places.
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; LCC critical value is 3.0 in low N response cultures like White Ponni and 4.0 in other cultivars and hybrids
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; When  6/10  observations  show  less  than  the  critical  colour  value,  N  can  be applied as per the following recommendation : Application  of 25 kg N ha -1 (1 bag  urea)  at  7  DAT  followed    by  N  @  40  kg  ha -1 each  time  for  kuruvai/  short duration rice / 30 kg ha -1 each time for medium &amp; long duration rice as and when the leaf colour value falls below the critical value of 4 for varieties and hybrids and critical value of 3 for white ponni, monitored from 14 DAT.
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; For aged seedlings : Basal application of 35 kg N per ha is recommended to avoid yield loss when seedlings aged 35 - 45 days are used for transplanting and the LCC based N management can be followed from 14 DAT.
- **Recommendation of P&amp;K fertilizer rates based on SSNM approach for rice growing tracts of Tamil Nadu (other than Cauvery Delta)

- ** The above SSNM based fertilizer P and K arrived based on yield response are recommended for specific soil series prevailing in different rice growing areas for adoption by farmers

## Split application of N and K

- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Apply N and K in four equal splits viz., basal, tillering, panicle initiation and heading stages.
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Tillering and Panicle initiation periods are crucial and should not be reduced with the recommended quantity.
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; N management through LCC may be adopted wherever chart is  available

## Application of P fertilizer

- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; P may be applied as basal and  incorporated.
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; When  the  green  manure  is  applied,  rock  phosphate  can  be  used  as  a  cheap source of P fertilizer. If rock phosphate is applied, the succeeding rice crop need not be supplied with P. Application of rock phosphate + single super phosphate or DAP mixed in different proportions (75:25 or 50:50) is equally effective as SSP or DAP alone.

## Application of micronutrients

## Soil Application

- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Soil application of  25 kg  zinc sulphate/ha mixed with 50 kg dry sand or apply  25 kg  of  TNAU    Wetland    rice  MN  mixture/ha  enriched  in  FYM  at  1:10  ratio incubated  for 30 days  at friable  moisture, just before transplanting.
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; It is enough to apply 12.5 kg zinc sulphate /ha, if green  manure  (6.25  t/ha)  or enriched  FYM, is applied.
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; For saline and sodic acid 37.5 kg ZnSO4 can be applied.
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Apply 500 kg of gypsum/ha (as source of Ca and S nutrients) at last ploughing. Application of 50 kg FeSO4 + 12.5 t FYM /ha, 40 kg S as gypsum can be followed, if the soils are deficient in respective elements.
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; For Cauvery delta zone, application of 5 kg CuSO4 can be recommended.

## Foliar nutrition

- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Foliar spray of 1% urea + 2% MAP + 1% KCl at Panicle Initiation (PI) and 10 days after first spray to inprove grain filling rate and yield in all varieties.
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; If deficiency symptom appears in the standing crop (15 days after transplanting) foliar application of 0.5% zinc sulphate + 1.0% urea can be given at 7-10 days for short duration and 15 days interval for medium and copy duration crop until the Zn deficiency symptoms disappear.
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Biofortification strategies; For biofortification of Zn in rice, the efficient cultivars viz., CO51, CO47, ADT 47, ADT 37 may be grown with the basal soil application of 50 kg ZnSO4 alongwith foliar spraying of 0.50% ZnSO4 thrice at 50% flowering, milky and dough stages to enrich the grain Zn content.

## Nutrient deficiency / toxicity symptoms

- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Nitrogen deficiency :  Plants become stunted and yellow in appearance  first on lower  leaves.  In  case  of  severe  deficiency  the  leaves  will  turn  brown  and  die. Deficiency symptoms first appear at the leaf-tip and progress  along the midrib until the entire leaf is dead.
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Potassium deficiency : Bluish green leaves - when young,  older leaves irregular.

- Chlorotic  and necrotic areas - grain formation is poor - weakening of the straw which results in lodging.
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Magnesium deficiency: Leaves are chlorotic with white tips.
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Zinc  deficiency: Lower  leaves  have  chlorotic  particularly  towards  the  base. Deficient  plants give a brown rusty  appearance.
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Copper deficiency: : Leaves develop chlorotic streaks on either side of the midrib and appearance of dark brown necrotic lesions  on leaf tips. Unfolding  of the new leaves  will also  be seen.
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Iron toxicity: Brown spots on the lower leaves starting from tips and proceeding to the leaf base and turns into green or orange purple leaves and spreading to the next above leaves.

## Neem treated urea and coal-tar treated urea

Blend the urea with crushed neem seed or neem cake 20% by weight. Powder neem  cake  to  pass  through  2mm  sieve  before  mixing  with  urea.  Keep  it  overnight before use (or) urea can be mixed with gypsum in 1:3 ratios, or urea can be mixed with gypsum  and  neem  cake  at  5:4:1  ratio  to  increase  the  nitrogen  use  efficiency.  For treating 100 kg urea, take one kg coal-tar  and 1.5 litres of kerosene.  Melt coal-tar over a  low  flame  and  dissolve  it  in  kerosene.  Mix  urea  with  the  solution  thoroughly  in  a plastic container, using a stick. Allow it to dry in shade on a polythene sheet. This can be stored for a month and applied basally.

## N management through LCC For sodic soil

In the case of sodic soils, LCC critical value is 4.0 for varieties and 5.0 for the hybrids.

## Other special cultural practices (Contingent Plan)

Application of Pink Pigmented Facultative Methylotroph ( Methylobacterium sp.) as seed treatment (@ 200 g / 10 kg seeds), soil application (@ 2 kg / ha) and foliar spray (@ 500 ml / ha) at panicle initiation and flag leaf stages for alleviation of water stress effects  in both  SRI  and  transplanted system of rice cultivation.

## 1.2.4. Weed management

- · Use  of  rotary  weeder  from  15  DAT  at  10  days  interval.  It  saves  labour  for weeding,    aerates    the  soil  and  root  zone,  prolongs  the  root  activity,  and improves the grain filling though efficient translocation and ultimately the grain yield.
- · Cultural  practices  like  dual  cropping  of  rice-azolla,  and  rice-green  manure (described in wet seeded rice section 2.5 &amp; 2.6 of this chapter) reduces the weed infestation to a greater extent.
- · Summer ploughing and cultivation of irrigated dry crops during post-rainy periods reduces the weed infestation.

## Pre-emergence herbicides

- · Use  Butachlor  1.25kg/ha  or  Anilophos  0.4kg/ha  as  pre-emergence  application. Alternatively,  pre-emergence  application  of  herbicide  mixture  viz.,  Butachlor 0.6kg  +  2,4  DEE  0.75kg/ha,  or  Anilophos  +  2,  4  DEE  'ready-mix'  at  0.4kg/ha followed by one hand weeding  on 30 - 35 DAT  will have a broad spectrum of weed control.

- · Any herbicide has to be mixed with 50kg  of dry sand  on the  day  of application (3  -  4  DAT)    and  applied  uniformly  to  the  field  with  thin  film  water  on  the  3 rd DAT.  Water  should  not  be    drained  for  next  2  days  from  the  field  (or)  fresh irrigation should not be given.
- · Pre-emergence application of pretilachor  at 1.0 kg ha -1 on  3  DAT    +  weeding with  Twin  row rotary weeder at 40  DAT
- · PE Pyrazosulfuron ethyl @ 20 g ha -1 on 3 DAT + hand weeding (HW) on 45 DAT.
- · PE butachlor 0.75 kg ha -1 + bensulfuron methyl 50 g ha -1 on 3 DAT + HW on 45 DAT
- · PE  Oxadiazon  87.5  g  ha -1 followed  by  Post  emergence  (POE)    2,4-D  1  kg  ha -1 along  with hand weeding on 35  DAT.
- · PE  butachlor  0.75  kg  per  hectare  +  bensulfuron  methyl  50  g  ha -1 on  3  DAT followed by mechanical weeding on 45 DAT is effective for broad spectrum weed control.
- · Crop growth and yield were enhanced by butachlor 1.2 + 2,4-DEE 1.5 lit ha -1 with 100% inorganic nitrogen.
- · Conventional tillage of one dry ploughing and two passes of cage wheel puddling combined  with pre-emergence application  of  butachlor  at  1.25  kg  ha -1 under lowland situation.
- · Stale bed preparation by pre-puddling minimum tillage with glyphosate  combine with  post- plant pre emergence butachlor 1.25 kg ha -1 resulted in increased rice grain yield, net income  and B: C ratio in rice-rice  cropping.
- · If  pre-emergence  herbicide  application  is  not  done,  hand  weeding  has  to  be done  on 15 th DAT.
- · 2,4-D sodium salt (Fernoxone 80% WP) 1.25 kg/ha dissolved in 625 litres with a high volume sprayer, three weeks after transplanting or when the weeds are in 3 - 4 leaf stage.
- · Early post emergence application of Bispyripac sodium 40 g ha -1 (2-3 leaf stage of weeds)  + Hand weeding on 45 DAT
- · Pre emergence application of Pretilachlor @ 750 g/ha at 3 DAT followed by post emergence application of Chlorimuron methyl + Metsulfuron methyl @ 4 g/ha on 25 DAT had higher weed contol efficiency and net return.
- · Pre emergence application of Butachlor @ 1.0 kg ai/ha on 3 DAT + Finger type single row or double row rotary weeders weeding on 45 DAT. If pre emergence application  is  avoided,  then  finger  type  single  row/double  row  rotary  weeders weeding on 20 and 40 DAT.

## 1.2.5. Water management

- · Puddling and leveling minimizes the water requirement
- · Plough with tractor drawn cage wheel to reduce percolation losses and to save water requirement up to 20%.
- · Maintain  2.5cm  of  water  over  the  puddle  and  allow  the  green  manure  to decompose  for  a  minimum  of  7  days  in  the  case  of  less  fibrous  plants  like sunnhemp  and  15  days    for  more  fibrous  green  manure  plants  like  Kolinchi ( Tephrosia purpurea ).
- · At the time of transplanting, a shallow depth of 2cm of water is adequate since high depth of water will lead to deep planting resulting in reduction of tillering.

- · Maintain 2 cm of water up to seven days of transplanting.
- · After the establishment stage, cyclic  submergence  of water  (as in table)  is the best    practice  for  rice  crop.  This  cyclic  5cm  submergence  has  to  be  continued throughout the crop period.
- · Moisture  stress  due  to  inadequate  water  at  rooting  and  tillering  stage  causes poor root growth leading to reduction in tillering, poor stand and low yield.
- · Critical stages of water requirement in rice are a) panicle initiation, b) booting, c)
- heading and d) flowering. During these stages, the irrigation interval should not exceed the stipulated  time  so as to cause the depletion of moisture below the saturation level.
- · During  booting  and  maturity  stages  continuous  inundation  of  5cm  and  above leads to advancement in root decay and leaf senescence, delay in heading and reduction  in  the number of filled grains per panicle and poor harvest index.
- · Provide  adequate  drainage    facilities  to  drain  excess  water  or  strictly  follow irrigation    schedule    of  one  day  after  disappearance  of  ponded  water.  Last irrigation may be 15 days ahead of harvest.

Days after disappearance of ponded water at which irrigation is to be given

| Soil type   | Summer                                       | Winter     |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|------------|
| Loamy       | 1 day                                        | 3 days     |
| Clay        | Just before/immediately  after disappearance | 1 - 2 days |

## Precautions for irrigation

- · The field plot size can be 25 to 50 cents depending on the source of  irrigation.
- · Field to field irrigation should be avoided. Field should be  irrigated  individually from  a  channel.
- · Small bund may be formed parallel to the main bund of the field at a distance of 30  to  45  cm  within  the  field  to  avoid  leakages  of  water  through  main  bund crevices.
- · To minimize percolation loss, the depth of stagnated water should be 5 cm or less.
- · In water logged condition, form open drains, about 60 cm in depth and 45 cm width across the field.
- · Care should be taken not to allow development of cracks.
- · In  canal  command  area,  conjunctive  use  of  surface  and  ground  water  may  be resorted to for judicious use of water.

## Alternate Wetting and Drying Irrigation (AWDI)

- · Safe  Alternate  Wetting  and  Drying  Irrigation  (AWDI)  is  to  monitor  the  depth  of ponded water on the field using 'Field Water Tube' (FWT) which is made of 40 cm long plastic pipe with a diameter of 15 cm so that water table is easily visible.
- · Tube  is  perforated  with  0.5  cm  diameter  holes  in  the  bottom  and  the  top  15  cm portion is non-perforated.

- · Above the perforated portion, markings are made for 5 cm so that irrigation at 5 cm depth could be done.
- · One Field Water Tube is required for adopting the AWDI in an area of 1 acre. The FWT  is  installed  in  the  field  using  mallet  and  it  is  inserted  upto  the  perforated portion buried inside the soil. The soil inside the tube is to be removed.
- · FWT to be installed near the field levies so that the water level inside the FWT could be monitored easily.
- · Safe AWDI of 10 cm depletion in light soils and 15 cm depletion in heavy soils was found to improve the water use efficiency in rice.

## Non-Puddled machine Transplanted Rice (NPTR)

- · Traditional transplanted rice cultivation requires 1200-1400 mm of water of which puddling consumes 250 mm of water.
- · In  NPTR,  puddling  is  replaced  with  dry  ploughing  (using  cultivator  and  rotavator) followed by laser leveling and wetting.
- · Soil is allowed to settle for 12-24 hrs before transplanting very light irrigation is given again to maintain a uniform depth of 1 cm standing water.
- · Machine transplanting is adopted in the wetted soil.
- · Alternate Wetting and Drying Irrigation method is followed for water management.
- · Though there was a yield reduction, considerable water saving under NPTR from 120 to 245 mm.
- 1.3. Insect management: See Crop Protection Chapter
- 1.4. Disease management: See Crop Protection Chapter

## 1.5. Harvesting

- · Taking the average duration of the crop as an indication, drain the water from the field 7 to 10 days before the expected harvest date as draining hastens maturity and improves harvesting conditions.
- · When 80% of the panicles turn straw colour, the crop is ready for harvest. Even at this stage,  the leaves of some of the varieties may remain green.
- · Confirm maturity by selecting the most mature tiller and dehusk  a few grains.  If the rice  is  clear and firm, it is in hard dough  stage.
- · When most of the grains at the base of the panicle in the selected tiller are in a hard dough stage, the crop is ready for harvest. At this stage harvest the crop, thresh and winnow the  grains.
- · Dry the grains to 12% moisture level for storage. Grain yield in rice is estimated only at 14% moisture for any comparison.
- · Maturity may be hastened by 3-4 days by spraying 20% NaCl a  week  before harvest  to escape monsoon rains.

## 1.6. Seedling throwing method of stand establishment

- · 20 days old seedlings of short duration rice varieties
- · Requirement of seedlings will be approximately 20% more than the line planting or equal to random planting.
- · The seedlings are thrown into the puddled leveled field by labour without using force.
- · Suitable for all seasons except Thaladi or heavy rain season.
- · 50% labour shaving as compared to line planting and 35% to random planting.

- · Up to 7-10 days of seedling throwing care should be taken to maintain thin film of  water (similar to wet seeded  rice).
- · Other cultural operations are same as in transplanted rice
- · Grain yield will be equal to line planted crop and 10-12% higher than random planted crop.

## 1.7. Transplanted hybrid rice

| Seed rate       | 20 kg per hectare                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

- · Preparation of soil mixture: Four (4) m  of soil mix is needed for each 100 m  of 3 2 nursery. Mix 70% soil + 20% well-decomposed pressmud / bio-gas slurry / FYM + 10%  rice  hull.  Incorporate 1.5 kg of powdered DAP or 2 kg 17-17-17 NPK fertilizer in the soil mixture.

- · Filling in soil mixture: Place a wooden frame of 0.5 m long, 1 m wide and 4 cm deep divided  into 4 equal segments on the plastic sheet or banana leaves. Fill the frame almost to the top with the soil mixture.
- · Seed Treatment with biofertilizers : Five packets (1 kg/ha) of Azospirillum and five packets  (1  kg/ha)  of Phosphobacteria  or  five  packets  (1  kg/ha)  of  Azophos. Biofertilizers are mixed with water used for soaking and kept for 4 hrs. The bacterial suspension after draining may be sprinkled in the nursery before sowing the treated seeds
- · Pre-germinating the seeds 2 days before sowing: Soak the seeds for 24  hr,  drain and  incubate the soaked seeds for 24 hr, sow when the seeds sprout  and radicle (seed root)  grows to 2-3 mm long.
- · Soil  application  of  biofertilizers  : Application  of Azospirillum @  2    kg    and Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi @ 5 kg for 100 m  nursery area 2
- · Sowing: Sow the pre-germinated seeds weighing 90 -100 g / m -2 (100g dry seed may weigh 130g after sprouting) uniformly and cover them with dry soil to a thickness of 5mm. Sprinkle water immediately using rose can to soak the bed and remove the wooden  frame  and  continue the process until the required area is completed.
- · Watering: Water the nursery with rose can as and when needed  (twice  or thrice
- a day) to  keep the soil moist. Protect the nursery from heavy rains for the first 5 DAS.  At 6 DAS,  maintain thin film of water all around the seedling mats. Drain the water 2 days  before  removing the seedling mats for transplanting.
- · Spraying  fertilizer  solution (optional):  If  seedling  growth  is  slow,  sprinkle  0.5% urea + 0.5%  zinc sulphate solution at 8-10  DAS.
- · Lifting  seedling  mats: Seedlings  reach  sufficient  height  for  planting  at    15 days. Lift the seedling mats and transport them to main field.
- · For  elite  seedling  production  under  modified  mat  nursery  :  seed  fortification with 1.0% KCl mixed with native soil and powdered DAP @ 2.0 kg per cent along with Pseudomonas 240 g/ cent followed by drenching with 0.5 % urea solution on 9 DAS

## 1.8.4. Main field preparation

- · Puddled lowland prepared as described in transplanted  section
- · Perfect leveling is a pre-requisite for the water management  proposed hereunder

## 1.8.5. Transplanting

- · 1-2 seedlings of 14-15 days old
- · Square planting of 25 x 25 cm (10 x 10 inch)
- · Fill up the gaps between 7 th and 10 th DAT.
- · Transplant within 30 minutes of pulling out of seedlings.
- · There  may  be  difficulty  in  crop  establishment  in  areas  with  heavy  downpour (North East Monsoon periods of Tamil Nadu)

## 1.8.6. Irrigation management

- · Irrigation to be done so as to moist the soil during early period upto 10 days
- · Restoring irrigation to a maximum depth of 2.5 cm after development of hairline

- cracks in the soil until panicle initiation  (PI)
- · Increasing  irrigation  depth  to  5.0  cm  after  PI  one  day  after  disappearance  of ponded water till completion of flowering stage.
- · Placing  of  water  pipe  as  safe  alternate  wetting  and  drying  irrigation  (AWDI) reduces the total number of irrigation given to rice crop (Perforated water pipe is placed 10 - 15 cm below the soil surface and the water lever moderation observed for time of irrigation)

## 1.8.7. Weed management

- · Using rotary weeder / Cono weeder / power operated two row weeder
- · Moving the weeder with forward and backward motion to burry the weeds and as well as to aerate the soil at 7-10 days interval from 10-15 days after planting on either direction of the row and column.
- · Manual weeding is also essential to remove the weeds closer to rice root zone.

## 1.8.8. Nutrient management

- · As per transplanted rice.
- · Use of LCC has more advantage in N management.
- · Green manure and farm yard manure application will enhance the growth and yield of rice in this system approach.

## 2. WET SEEDED PUDDLED LOWLAND RICE

## WET SEEDED RICE

## 2.1 Area

- · Direct wet seeding can be followed in all the areas wherein transplanting is in vogue.

## 2.2. Season

- · As that of translated  rice

## 2.3.Field preparation

- · On receipt of showers during the months of May - July repeated ploughing should be carried out so as to conserve the moisture, destroy the weeds and break the  clods.
- · After inundation puddling is to be done as per transplanting. More care should be taken to level the field to zero  level.
- · Stagnation of water in patches during germination and early establishment of the crop leads to uneven crop stand.
- · Land leveling has say over efficient weed and water management practices.
- · Provision of shallow trenches (15 cm width) at an interval of 3m all along the field will facilitate the draining of excess water at the early growth stage.

## 2.4. Varieties

All  the  varieties  recommended  for  transplanting  can  do  well  under  direct  wet seeded  conditions also. However, the following varieties are more suited.

| Varieties                                                | Duration (days)   | Time of sowing                                                               |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ponmani                                                  | 160 to 165        | 1  to 30 st th  August for  Samba                                            |
| CO 43, IR20, ADT 38 ADT 39, Ponni,  Improved White Ponni | 125 to135         | 1  to 30 st th  September for  Thaladi                                       |
| ADT 36, ADT 37                                           | 105 to 110        | 1  to 10 st th  June for  Kuruvai  1  to 10 st th  October for late  Thaladi |

## 2.5. Sowing

- · Follow a seed rate of 60 kg /  ha
- · Pre-germinate the seeds as for wet nursery
- · Seed treatments as adopted for transplanted rice
- · Sow the seeds by drum seeder or broadcast uniformly with thin film of water.
- · Dual cropping of rice-green manure is economic for nutrient budget and efficient for grain production. For this method use 'TNAU Rice-Green manure seeder'.

## TNAU Rice cum Green manure seeder

- · Manually drawn seeder developed at TNAU to sow pre-germinated paddy and green manure daincha crop ( Sesbania aculeata ) in alternate rows in puddled soil.
- · On attaining a height of 40 cm after about one month of sowing the daincha crop was trampled by using long handled IRRI design cono weeder.
- · Seeder sows four paddy rows and four daincha rows in a single pass.
- · Using one (male) operator and two women labourers half of ha can be sown with the seeder in a day of 8 hours.
- · Paddy was sown at 60 kg/ha seed rate and green manure crop at 20 kg/ha seed rate. The distance  between  the  adjacent  rows  is  12.5  cm.  When  compared  to  sole  wet seeded rice, weeds are better controlled in the wet seeded rice inter-cropped with green manure.
- · Also intercropping of rice with green manure dhaincha and incorporation at 7.0 t/ha enhanced the growth and yield of rice and beneficial in terms of N addition (40 kg N /ha).
- · There is greater possibility of intercropping green manures during early stage of rice crop with increased grain yield by one tones / ha.

## POST HARVEST TECHNOLOGY OF RICE PROCESSING OF RICE Parboiling

- 5.14.23.

Parboiling is a hydrothermal treatment followed by drying before milling for the production of milled parboiled grain. Parboiling of paddy has been known  in the orient  for  centuries.    Nearly  50  per  cent  of  the  paddy  produced  in  India  at present is  parboiled.

5.14.24. In general, the three major steps in parboiling, i.e. soaking, steaming and drying and have a great influence on the final characteristics and quality of parboiled rice.

- 5.14.25. Parboiling is the latest premilling treatment which improves the quality of rice. The traditional parboiling process in India is carried out in different ways.
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Paddy
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Cleaning
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Soaking in water (8 h)

## PROCESSED PRODUCTS

## Parched rice *

It is prepared by throwing rice in sand heated to a high temperature in an iron or mud pan. On stirring, rice begins to crackle and swell. Then the content of the pan are removed and sieved to  separate the parched rice from sand. Parboiled rice is used for making grayish to brilliant white colour parched rice and sold either salted or unsalted. It is eaten as such or mixed with butter milk or milk.

## Expanded cereals Expanded rice (Pori) *

- 5.14.26. Expanded rice (murmura, pori, muri) is a traditional  convenience  food    widely consumed    in  India  either  as  such  or  with  Jaggery,  roasted  Bengal  gram  and shredded  vegetables  and spices.  The product  is mostly  produced  in home or cottage sector by skilled artisans.
- 5.14.27. In  the  traditional  process,  the  paddy  is  soaked  in  water  preferably  over  night until  saturation,  drained  and  then  either  steamed  or  dry  roasted  in  sand  for parboiling. The parboiled paddy is milled, salted and again roasted in sand  for expansion.

## Puffing / Popping * Puffed rice : (using rice)

This popular ready-to-eat snack product is obtained by puffing milled parboiled rice. In the traditional process rice is gently heated on the furnace without sand to reduce the

moisture content slightly. It is then mixed with salt solution  and again roasted  on furnace in small batches  with sand on a strong fire for a few seconds to produce the expanded rice. Rice  expands  about  8 times  retaining the grain shape and is highly porous and crisp.

## Parched paddy or puffed rice: (using paddy)

Sun dried paddy is filled in mud jars and is moistened  with hot water.  After 2-3 min. the water  is decanted and the jars are kept in an inverted position for 8-10 hours. Next the paddy  is exposed  to the sun for a short time and then  parched  in hot sand  as in the preparation  of parched  rice. Puffed  rice is prepared by throwing pretreated paddy into sand heated to a high temperature in an iron pan. During parching the grain swell and burst into a soft white product. The parched grains are sieved to remove sand and winnowed to separate the husk.

## Puffed rice from parboiled rice

The rice is soaked in salt water to increase the moisture to about 20%. The moist rice is introduced into a hot vessel at about 250-275 C for 30-40 seconds. The rice puffs suddenly. o

## Popped rice

This is yet another traditional value added product prepared from raw paddy. The paddy at a moisture content of 12-14% is directly  roasted  in iron pans using  sand as a medium  at a temperature of 150-200 C. The production of popped rice is comparatively o less and the product is mainly used in religious functions and  ceremonies.

## Flaking *

Flaked rice is another important value added product prepared from paddy. Traditionally, it is  prepared  from  soaked  paddy,  after  heat  treatment  and  immediate  flattening    using    a flaking  machine (an edge runner)

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## Flaked rice

Flaked rice is made from parboiled rice. Paddy is soaked in water for 2 -3 days to soften the kernel followed  by boiling water for a few minutes and the water is drained  off. The paddy is  heated in   a shallow earthen vessel or sand in iron pan till the husks break open.  It is pounded  by a wooden  pestle which flattens the kernel and removes the husk. The husk is separated  by winnowing.  Flaked  rice is thin and papery and of white colour.

Quick cooking rice is made by steeping  polished  rice in water  to a moisture  content  of 35 per  cent,  cooking  under  pressure  and  drying.  Alternatively  the  rice  may  be  subjected    to freezing, thawing and dehydration.

## Derived products

Polished  rice  may  be  precooked  and  canned  as  rice  pudding  and  also  used  to  make  dry breakfast cereals.

## RICE AND RICE PRODUCTS

Modernization of rice milling Industry also results in production of quality by-products  viz., broken rice, husk and rice bran. Technology is now available for the production of  valueadded products from these by-products.

## Byproducts of Rice Broken rice

The broken rice is widely used in the food preparations and in the industries for making flour  and in the manufacture of baby foods. The starch extracted from broken rice finds wider application in the pharmaceutical, textile and other industries.

## Rice husk

Rice husk that contains about 38% cellulose and 32% lignin and is one of the most abundant renewable agriculture based fuel materials. The production of rice husk is about 80 million tonnes  per  year,  equivalent  in  energy  to  about  170  million  barrels  of  oil.  Paddy    husk contains    about  22  per  cent    ash  of  which  95  per  cent  is  silica.  Because  of  its  high  silica content,  it  is  used  as  an  abrasive.  Large  quantities  of  husk  are  used  in  India  as  fuel  for boilers, kilns and household purposes.

## Rice bran

Commercially rice bran is the most valuable by-product, which is characterized by its high fat (15 to 20%) and protein content. It also contains  vitamins,  minerals  and many other useful chemicals.  It is a potential source of edible oil. Because of its nutritional value, it is being used as feed for poultry and livestock. More stable defatted bran containing higher percentage of  protein,  vitamins  and  minerals is an excellent ingredient for both food and feed. The bran is the most nutritious byproduct of rice milling and is used almost exclusively as a feedstuff.  It  is  generally  contaminated  with  husk, which lowers its nutritive value. Rice bran contains about 12 per cent protein and 15 per cent fat.

## Rice bran oil

Bran oil is obtained by the extraction of rice bran with solvents. Bran oil is also obtained in the solvent extraction milling of rice. The oil contains a high percentage of unsaturated fatty acids, yet it is quite stable because of the presence  of natural antioxidants.  When refined, bleached  and deodorized, it is used for salad dressing and as cooking oil. Bran after solvent extraction  has a higher  percentage  of protein that the original material. With its low fat content it keeps well.

## Importance

Rice bran oil is the oil extracted from the germ and inner husk of rice. Rice bran oil is rich in vitamin  E, γ -oryzanol (an antioxidant that may  help  prevent  heart    attacks) and phytosterols (compounds believed to help lower cholesterol absorption) which may provide associated health benefits. It has a mild taste and is popular in Asian cuisine because of its suitability for  high-  temperature cooking methods such as deep-frying and stir-frying. Rice bran oil is mostly monounsaturated - a tablespoon contains 7 grams of monounsaturated

fat, three of saturated  fat and five of polyunsaturated  fat.

Rice bran oil also contains components of vitamin E that may benefit health. The unique components,  such  as  oryzanol  or  tocotrienol,  have  been    drawing    people's    attention. Numerous    studies  show  rice  bran  oil  reduces  the  harmful  cholesterol  (LDL)  without reducing good cholesterol (HDL). In those studies, Oryzanol is reported as the key element responsible  for  that  function.  Tocotrienol,  on  the  other  hand,  is  highlighted  as  the  most precious and powerful vitamin E existing in nature and is said to have an anti-cancer effect, too. As a Vitamin-E  source,  rice bran oil is rich not  only in alpha Tocopherol but also has the highest amount of Tocotrienol in liquid form vegetable  oils.

## Uses

Rice bran oil is ideal oil for margarine and shortening. The flavor gives the good palatability and the desired prime form crystal provides smooth plasticity  and  spreading  qualities. When   processed  to  retain  high  levels  of  tocols,  rice  bran  oil  may  be  used  as  a  natural antioxidant source for topically coating a wide range of products such as crackers, nuts, and similar snacks  to extend  shelf life.

## Rice polishing

Rice polishing is also rich in nutrients. They are not recovered in sizeable quantity in India.

They are mostly used as animal feed.

## Uses of defatted bran and bran

Defatted bran can be successfully used as an ingredient in the  bakery  products  such  as bread, cake, biscuits etc. After finer grinding, it can be incorporated  into maida flour up to 20 per cent  for the preparation of bakery products.

## C) Nematode management

-  Application  of  carbofuran  3G  @  1  kg  a.i./ha  both  in  nursery  and  in  main  field  at 45days after planting reduces of rice root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne graminicola .

## RICE - VARIETAL SEED PRODUCTION

## Land requirement

- · Land should be free of volunteer plants. The previous crop should not be the same variety or other varieties of the same crop. It can be the same variety, if it is certified as per the procedures of certification agency.

## Isolation

- · For certified / quality seed production, a distance of 3 m all around the field from the same and other varieties of the crop.

## Pre-sowing seed management

- · In  dormant cultivars,  break  the  dormancy  by  soaking  the  seeds  in  equal  volume  of 0.1 N conc. HNO3 or 0.5 % KNO3 for 12 - 16 h.
- · Upgrade  the  seeds  adapting  specific  gravity  grading  with  salt  solution  prepared  by dissolving 1.5 kg of common salt in 10 lit of water. Remove the floaters and sinkers should be used for sowing after repeated washing with water.
- · Harden  the  seeds  for  rainfed  or  direct  sowing  by  soaking  in  equal  volume  of 1% KCl solution for 16 h and dry back the seeds to original moisture content.
- · Soak the seed in 4% Pseudomonas fluorescens for  12 h at the ratio of 1 : 1 and dry back the seeds to original seed moisture content under shade.
- · Soak the seeds in equal volume of 80 µM concentration of sodium nitroprusside for 16 hrs to raise the nursery in saline / sodic soils.

## Method of planting

- · SRI method can be adapted.

## Recommendation for planting under saline soil condition

- · Incorporation of green manure like daincha in soil.
- · Shallow planting at 3 - 4 seedlings / hill.
- · Basal application of gypsum @ 500 kg / ha.
- · Foliar spray with 0.5 % FeSO4 and ZnSO4 at tillering stage.

## Recommendation for Zinc deficient soils

- · Apply ZnSO4 @ 25 kg / ha.

## Fertilizer recommendation for different duration varieties

• Short duration

: NPK @ 120:40:40 kg / ha

• Medium duration

: NPK @ 150:50:60 kg / ha

• Long duration

: NPK @ 150:50:80 kg / ha

## Roguing space

- · Leave a roguing space of 30 cm for every 150 cm.

## Foliar application

- · Foliar spray of 2 % DAP at boot leaf stage and at 5 - 10% flowering.

## Harvesting

- · When 90 % of the panicle are in golden yellow colour with the moisture content of 20%  for  short  and  medium  duration  varieties  and  17%  moisture  for  long  duration varieties.

## Threshing

- · Thresh either manually or using mechanical threshers at a seed moisture content of 16 - 17%.

## Drying

- · Dry  the  seeds  to  12  -  13  %  moisture  content  for  short  term  storage  and  8-9  % moisture for long term storage.

## Pre-storage seed treatment

- · Treat the seeds with carbendazim @ 2 g / kg of seed.
- · Treat the seeds with halogen mixture @ 3 g / kg (CaOCl2 + CaCO3 + arappu ( Albizzia amara ) leaf powder mixed in the ratio of 5:4:1) as eco-friendly treatment.
- · Seeds  of  poor  storable  paddy  varieties  (ADT  38,  ADT  46)    at  10  per  cent  moisture content    are  to  be  treated  with  halopolymer  @  4  g  /  kg  +  Bavistin  @  2  g  /  kg  + Imidacloprid @ 1 ml / kg  and stored in super grain bag  for extending the storability.

## Storage

- · Store the seeds in gunny or cloth bags for short term storage (8-9 months) with a seed moisture content of 12 - 13 %.
- · Store the seeds in polylined gunny bag for medium term storage (12- 15 months) with a seed moisture content of 8 - 9 %.
- · Store  the  seeds  in  700  gauge  polythene  bag  for  long  term  storage  (more  than 15 months) with a seed moisture content less than 8 %.

## RICE - HYBRID SEED PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES

## Land requirement

- · Select fertile land with good drainage and irrigation facilities.
- · Previous crop should not be different varieties / hybrids of paddy

## Isolation

- •
- Space isolation : 100 m
- · Time isolation : 25 days (later)
- · Barrier  isolation  :  Either  a  distance  of  30  m  with  vegetative  barrier  or  plastic  sheet with 2 m height.

## Staggered sowing

- · Male parent should be sown in three to four staggered sowings based on the duration of parental lines for continuous availability of pollen till the completion of flowering in the female parent.

## Main field management

## Spacing

- · Between 'A'  lines  10  cm;  between  'R'  lines  30  cm;  between  A  and  'R'  line  20  cm  : within rows 15 cm.

## Planting design

- · Two paired row @ 2 - 3 seedlings / hill.

## Fertilizer application

- · Apply NPK @ 150 : 60 : 60 kg / ha.
- · Apply N and K in 3 split doses during the basal, active tillering and panicle initiation stages.

## Foliar Application

- · Foliar spray of 2 % DAP at boot leaf stage and another at 5 - 10 % flowering stage.

## Special operations

## Foliar spray of GA3 @ 75 g/ha for Panicle exertion

- · First foliar spray of 40 g of GA3 at 5-10 % panicle emergence stage followed by  35 g of GA3 at 24 h after first spray.

Note: GA3 should be dissolved in 70 % ethyl alcohol.

## Supplementary pollination

- · Rope pulling or shaking the pollen parent (R line) with the help of two bamboo sticks at 30 - 40% of spikelets opening stage is followed as supplementary pollination technique. This process is repeated for 3 to 4 times during the day time (10 am to 1 pm) at an interval of 30 min and continued for 7 to 10 days during flowering period.

## Harvesting

- · Harvest the male parent (R line) first and remove completely from the field.
- · Then harvest the seed parent (A line).

## Grading

- · For getting better seed quality, size grade the seeds using 1.3 mm x 19 mm oblong sieve.
- · Size  graded  seeds  may  be  upgraded  by  density  grading  using  specific  gravity separator.  Heavy  and  medium  fractions  with  90  -  92%  recovery  are  selected  for seed purpose.

## Drying

- · Sundry the seeds to reduce the moisture content to 12 - 13 %.

## Pre-storage seed treatment

- · Treat the seeds with carbendazim @ 2 g / kg.
- · Treat the seeds with halogen mixture @ 3 g / kg (CaOCl2 + CaCO3 + arappu ( Albizzia amara ) leaf powder mixed in the ratio of 5:4:1 as eco-friendly treatment.

## I. SELECTION OF SEEDS

Good quality seeds are to be collected from disease and pest-free fields.

## Quantity of seed required

Irrigated Transplanted - 7.5 kg/ha; Direct sown - 10 kg/ha Rainfed Direct sown 15 kg/ha Sorghum under irrigated condition is raised both as a direct sown and transplanted crop. Transplanted crop has the following advantages:

- a. Main field duration is reduced by 10 days.
- b. Shoot fly, which attacks direct sown crops during the first 3 weeks and which is difficult to control, can be effectively and economically controlled in the nursery itself.
- c. Seedlings which show chlorotic and downy mildew symptoms can be eliminated, thereby incidence of downy mildew in the main field can be minimised.
- d. Optimum population can be maintained as only healthy seedlings are used for transplanting.
- e. Seed rate can also be reduced by 2.5 kg/ha.

## II. NURSERY PRACTICES

## 1. NURSERY PREPARATION

For raising seedlings to plant one hectare, select 7.5 cents (300 m  ) near a water 2 source where water will not stagnate.

## 2. APPLICATION OF FYM TO THE NURSERY

- i. Apply 750 kg of FYM or compost for 7.5 cents nursery and apply another  500 kg of compost  or FYM for covering the seeds after sowing.
- ii. Spread the manure evenly on the unploughed soil and incorporate by ploughing or apply just before last ploughing.

## 3. LAYING THE NURSERY

- i. Provide three separate  units of size 2 m x 1.5 m with 30 cm space in between the plots and  all around the unit for  irrigation.
- ii. Excavate the soil from the inter-space and all around to a depth  of 15 cm to form channels  and spread the soil removed on the bed and level.

## 4. PRE-TREATMENT OF SEEDS

- i. Treat the seeds 24 hours prior to sowing with Carbendazim or Captan or Thiram at 2g/kg of seed.
- ii. Carrier  based  formulation:  Treat  one  hectare  of  seeds  with  1  kg  each  of biofertilizers viz., Azsopirillum, Phosphobacteria (or) Azophos, Silicate solubilizing bacteria (SSB) / Potash  bacteria  (KRB)  and  25  g  of    powder formulation  of  AM  fungi  using  binder  (polymer),    shade  dry  for  30  minutes before sowing.
- iii. Liquid formulation: Treat one hectare of seeds with 125 ml of each biofertilizers viz., Azsopirillum, Phosphobacteria  (or)  Azophos  and  Silicate  solubilizing bacteria (SSB) shade dry for 30 minutes before sowing

## 5. SOWING AND COVERING THE SEEDS

- 1. Make shallow rills, not deeper than 1 cm on the bed by passing the fingers vertically over it.
- 2. Broadcast 7.5 kg of treated seeds evenly on the beds.
- 3. Cover by leveling the rills by passing the hand lightly over the soil.

## 6. WATER MANAGEMENT

- i. Provide one inlet to each nursery unit.
- ii. Allow water to enter through the inlet and cover all the channels till the raised beds  are covered with water and then cut off.
- iii. Adjust the frequency of irrigation according to the soil types as follows:

| Number of irrigations   | Red soil                 | Heavy soil               |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| First irrigation        | Immediately after sowing | Immediately after sowing |
| Second irrigation       | 3 rd   day after sowing  | 4 th   day after sowing  |
| Third irrigation        | 7 th   day after sowing  | 9 th   day after sowing  |
| Fourth irrigation       | 12 th   day after sowing | 16 th  day after sowing  |

NOTE: Do not keep the seedlings in the nursery for more than 18 days. If older seedlings are used, establishment and yield are adversely affected. Do not allow cracks to develop in the nursery by properly adjusting the quantity of irrigation water.

## MAIN FIELD PREPARATION FOR IRRIGATED  CROP

## 1. PLOUGHING

Plough the field with an iron plough once (or) twice.  Sorghum does not require fine tilth since it adversely affects germination and yield in the case of direct sown  crop. To overcome the subsoil hard pan in Alfisols (deep red soils) chiselling the field at 0.5 m

intervals  to  a  depth  of  40  cm  on  both  the  directions  of  the  field  followed  by  disc ploughing  once  and  cultivator  ploughing  twice  help  to  increase  the  yield  of  sorghum and the succeeding crops.

Application of FYM and 100% of recommended N can also be followed. In soils with subsoil hard pan, chiselling should be done every year at the start of the cropping sequence to create a favourable physical environment.

## 2. APPLICATION OF FYM

Spread 12.5 t/ha FYM or any compost along with 2 kg each Azospirillum, Phosphobacteria  or    2  kg  of  Azophos  on  the  unploughed  field  and  incorporate  the manure in the soil. Apply  well decomposed  poultry manure  @ 5 t/ha to improve the grain yield as well as physical properties of  soils.

## 3. FORMATION OF RIDGES AND FURROWS

- i. Form ridges and furrows of 6 m length and 45 cm apart
- ii. Form irrigation channels across the furrows
- iii. Alternatively form beds of sixe 10 m and 20 m depending on the availability of 2 2 water.

## 4. APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS Transplanted crop

If soil test recommendations  are not available,  adopt a blanket recommendation  of 90 N, 45 P2 O5 45 K2O kg/ha. Apply  N  @  50:25:25  %  at  0,  15  and  30  DAS  and  full dose  of  P2  O5  and  K   O  basally  before  planting.  Apply  30  kg  S  basally  for  sulphur 2 deficient soils. Soil test crop response based integrated plant  nutrition  system  (STCRIPNS) recommendation may be adopted for prescribing fertilizer doses for specified yield targets (ready reckoners are furnished).

## III. MANAGEMENT OF MAIN FIELD Spacing: 45  x 15  cm Population: 15/m

## 1. TRANSPLANTED CROP

- i. Pull out the seedlings when they are 15 to 18 days old.
- ii. Prepare  slurry  with  5  packets  of  Azospirillum  (1000g/ha)  and  5  packets (1000g/ha) of Phosphobacteria or 10 packets of Azophos (2000 g/ha) in 40 lit. of water and dip the root  portion of the seedlings in the solution for 15-30 minutes and  transplant.
- iii. Let in water through the  furrows
- iv. Plant one seedling per  hill
- v. Plant the seedlings at a depth of 3 to 5 cm.
- vi. Plant the seedlings on the side of the ridge, half the distance from the top of the ridge and the bottom.

## 2. DIRECT SOWN CROP

- i. In the case of pure crop of sorghum, maintain the seed rate at 10kg/ha.
- ii. In the case of inter crop of sorghum with pulse crop, maintain the seed rate of sorghum at 10 kg/ha and pulse crop at 10  kg/ha.
- iii. In the case of pure crop of sorghum,  sow the seeds  with  a spacing  of 15 cm between  seeds in the rows which are 45 cm  apart.
- iv. Maintain one plant per hill.
- v. If shootfly attack is there, remove the side shots and retain one healthy shoot.
- vi. Sow the seeds over the lines where fertilizers are placed.
- vii. Sow the seeds at a depth of 2 cm and cover with soil.
- viii. In the case of sorghum intercropped with pulses sow one paired row of sorghum

alternated    with  a  single  row  of  pulses.  The  spacing  between  the  row  of sorghum and pulse crop is 30 cm.

Forage  cowpea  CO  1  can  be  intercropped  in  sorghum  at  two  rows  of    fodder cowpea  in between paired rows of  sorghum.

## 3. WEED MANAGEMENT

- i. Apply PE Atrazine @ 0.25 kg/ha on 3-5 DAS followed by 2,4-D @ 1 kg/ha on 2025 DAS on  the soil surface, using Backpack/Knapsack/Rocker sprayer fitted with a flat fan nozzle using 500 litres of water/ha (or) if herbicides are not used, hand weeding twice on 10-15 DAS and 30-35 DAS.

## v. Stop irrigation  thereafter

NOTE : Adjust irrigation schedule according to the weather  conditions  and  depending  upon  the receipt  of  rains.  Contingent  Plans  to  be  done  before  75%  of  soil    moisture    is    lost    from available water. Foliar Spray of 3% Kaolin (30 g in one litre of water) during  period  of stress

will  mitigate the ill effects.

## V. HARVESTING AND PROCESSING

- i. Consider the average duration of the crop and observe  the crop. When  the crop matures  the leaves turn yellow and present a dried up appearance.
- ii. The grains are hard and  firm.
- iv. Cut the stalk after a week, allow it to dry and then stack.
- iii. At this stage, harvest the crop by cutting the earheads separately.
- v. In the case of tall varieties, cut the stem at 10 to 15 cm above ground level and afterwards separate the earheads and stack the stalk.
- vi. Dry the earheads.
- vii. Thresh using a mechanical thresher or by drawing a stone roller over the earheads or by using cattle and dry the produce and store.

## RATOON SORGHUM CROP

## 1. RATOONING TECHNIQUE

- i. Harvest the main crop leaving 15 cm stubbles.
- ii. Remove the first formed two sprouts from the main crop and allow only the later formed two sprouts to grow. Allow two tillers per hill.

## 2. HOEING AND WEEDING

- i. Remove the weeds immediately after harvest of the main crop.
- ii. Hoe and weed twice on 15 th and 30 th day after cutting.

## 3. APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS

- i. Apply 100 kg N/ha in two split  doses.
- ii. Apply the first dose on 15 th day after cutting and the second on 45 th day after cutting.
- iii. Apply 50 kg P2 O5 /ha along with the application of N on 45 th day.

## 4. WATER MANAGEMENT

- i. Irrigate immediately after cutting the main crop.
- ii. Irrigation should not be delayed for more than 24 hours after cutting.
- iii. Irrigate on 3 rd or 4 th day after  cutting.
- iv. Subsequently irrigate once in 7 - 10 days.
- v. Stop irrigation on 70 - 80 days after ratooning.

## 5. HARVEST

Harvest the crop when the grains turn yellow.

NOTE: The duration of the ratoon crop is about 15 days less than the main crop.

## RAINFED SORGHUM

## 1. RAINFALL

Average and well distributed rainfall of 250-300 mm is optimum for rainfed sorghum.

## 2. DISTRIBUTION

Madurai, Dindigul,  Theni, Ramanathapuram, Tirunelveli,  Thoothukudi, Virudhunagar,  Sivagangai,  Tiruchirapalli,  Erode,  Salem,  Namakkal,  Coimbatore  and Dharmapuri Districts.

## 3. SEASON

The  crop  can  be  grown  in  South  West  and  North  East  monsoon    seasons provided  the rainfall is evenly distributed.

## 4. FIELD PREPARATION

- i         Field has to be prepared well in advance taking advantage of early showers. FYM application  should  be  done  @  12.5  t  /  ha  and  well  incorporated  at  the time  of  ploughing.
- ii. Chiseling for soils with hard pan Chisel the soils having hard pan formation at shallow depths with chisel plough at 0.5 m interval, first in one direction and then in the direction perpendicular to the previous  one  once in three years. Apply 12.5 t FYM or composted  Coir pith/ha  besides  chiseling  to get  an additional yield of about 30% over control.
- iii. To  conserve  the  soil  moisture  sow  the  seeds  in  flat  beds  and  form  furrows between crop rows during inter cultivation or during third week after  sowing.

## 5. SEED RATE

15 kg/ha

## 6. SEED TREATMENT Direct sown crop

Seed  hardening  ensures  high  germination.  The  seeds  are  pre-soaked  in  2% potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution for 6 hours in equal volume and then  dried back  to  its  original  moisture content in shade and are used for sowing. (or)

- i) Harden  the  seeds  with  1%  aquous  fresh  leaf  extract  of Prosopis  juliflora and pungam, ( Pongamia pinnata )  mixed  in  1:1  for  16  hrs  at  1:0.6  ratio  (Seed  and solution)  followed  by  drying and subsequently pelleting the seeds with Pungam leaf powder @300 g/kg with gruel.
- ii) Halogenise the seeds containing CaOCl, CaCO3 and arappu leaf powder @ 5:4:1 ratio  or  iodine based (containing 2 mg of Iodine in 3 g of CaCO3) formulation @ 3g/kg packed in polylined cloth bag to maintain seed viability for more than 10 month.
- iii) Treat the seeds with three packets  of azospirillum  (600 g) and 3 packets  of phosphobacteria  or 6 packets of Azophos (1200 g/ha). In the main field, apply 10 packets of azospirillum 2000g/ha and 10 packets (2000g/ha) of

- phosphobacteria or 20 packets of Azophos (4000  g/ha)  with phosphobacteria 2 kg with 25 kg FYM + 25 kg soil.
- iv) The seed is pelletised with 15 g of Chloropyriphos in 150 ml of gum and shade dried.

## 7. SOWING

Sow the seeds well before the onset of monsoon at 5 cm depth (by seed drill or by country plough).

## Pre-monsoon sowing

Sow the hardened seeds at 5 cm depth with seed cum fertilizer  drill to ensure uniform  depth of sowing and fertilizer application before the onset of monsoon as detailed below:

## District

## Optimum period

1. Coimbatore

37-38th week (II to III week of Sep.)

2. Erode

38th week (III week of  Sep.)

3. Sivaganga

40th week (I week of  Oct.)

4. Ramanathapuram

40th week (I week of  Oct.)

5. Thoothukudi

39-40th week (Last week of Sep. to I week of Oct)

6. Vellore, Tiruvannamalai

37th-38th week (Sep. II week to Sep. III  week)

- i. Sow the sorghum seeds over the line where the fertilizers are placed.
- ii. Sow the seeds at a depth of 5 cm and cover with the soil.
- iii. Sow the seeds with the spacings of 15 cm in the paired rows spaced 60 cm apart.
- iv. Sow the pulse seeds to fall 10 cm apart in the furrows between the paired rows of sorghum.

## 8. SPACING

45 x 15 cm or 45 x 10 cm.

## 9. FERTILIZER

Apply 12.5 t/ha of Composted Coir pith + NPK at 40:20:0; Apply enriched  FYM @ 750 kg/ha.  The recommended dose of 40 kg N and 20 kg P2 O5 /ha for rainfed sorghum can be halved if FYM @ 5 t/ha is applied.

## 10. WEED MANAGEMENT

Keep sorghum field free of weeds from second week after germination till  5 th week.    If  sufficient  moisture  is  available  spray  Atrazine  0.25  kg/ha  as  pre-emergence application within 3 days after the receipt of the soaking rainfall for sole sorghum and for sorghum based intercropping system with pulses, use Pendimethalin at 0.75 kg/ha.

Under rainfed sorghum intercropped with cowpea as a pre-plant incorporation of isoproturan  @ 0.5 kg ha -1 gave good control of weed with applied after  1 st and 2 nd spell of rainfall pendimethalin 1.0 kg ha -1 will be safer for both the crops.

## 11. CROPPING SYSTEM

- · The most profitable and remunerative sorghum based cropping system adopted is  sorghum  with cowpea, redgram, lab-lab, blackgram.
- · In  rainfed  Vertisol,  adopt  paired  row  planting  in  sorghum  and  sow  one  row  of blackgram/ cowpea  in between  paired rows of sorghum  to have 100% population of sorghum plus 33% population of blackgram/cowpea.
- · Intercropping of sunflower CO 1, with the main crop of sorghum CO 26 in 4:2 ratio is recommended under rainfed conditions during North-East monsoon for black soils of  CBE.
- · Intercropping  of  soybean  with  sorghum  in  the  ratio  4:2  is  recommended  for kharif seasons.
- · For  sorghum  -  blackgram  intercropping    system  as  well  as  sole  cropping, application    of  20  kg  N    and    20    kg    P    O  /ha    through    enriched    FYM    and treating    the    seeds    with    Azospirillum  is  25  recommended  for  Aruppukottai region.
- · For sorghum (CO 25) + Fodder cowpea (CO 1) intercropping system, application of 20 kg N and 20 kg P O /ha with enriched FYM is recommended for Coimbatore region 25
- · The intercropping system, fodder sorghum (K 7) + Fodder cowpea (CO 5) at 3:2 ratio is found profitable for rainfed Vertisols of Aruppukottai.
- · Tamarind and Neem trees upto 3-4 years from date of planting  form an ideal tree component  for agroforestry in black cotton soils of Kovilpatti. Sorghum and blackgram gave higher yield even at 50 per cent of the recommended level of fertilizer  application.

## CROP PROTECTION

## A. Pest management

- · Protect nursery by applying any one of the following insecticides (in 6 litres of water) on 7th and 14th day of sowing
- · Methyl demeton 25EC 12 ml
- · Dimethoate 30EC 12 ml
- · Plough soon after harvest, remove and destroy the stubbles.
- · Treat seeds with chlorpyriphos 20EC or phosalone 35 EC (4 ml/kg) or imidacloprid 48FS or imidacloprid 70WS or thiamethoxam 30FS (10 g/kg) before sowing.
- · Avoid repeated application of insecticides which may induce resurgence
- · The sowing of sorghum should be completed in as short a time as possible to avoid continuous flowering which favours grain midge and earhead bug multiplication in an area.
- · Set  up light traps till mid night to monitor, attract and kill adults of stem borer, grain midge and earhead caterpillars.

## SORGHUM - VARIETAL SEED PRODUCTION

## Land requirement

- · Land should be free of volunteer plants. The previous crop should not be the same variety  or  other  varieties  of  the  same  crop.  It  can  be  the  same  variety,  if  it  is certified as per the procedures of certification agency.

## Isolation

- · For certified / quality seed production leave a distance of 100 m all around the field from the same and other varieties of the crop.
- · The distance may be extended to 400 m for the presence of Johnson grass.

## Season

- · June - July and October - November.

## Pre-sowing seed treatment

- · Soak the seeds in KH2PO4 2 % for 16 h at of 1:0.6 ratio and dry back the seeds to original seed moisture content (8 - 9 %) under shade. This can be adopted both for the garden and dry land ecosystem.
- · Soak the seed in 4% Pseudomonas fluorescens for 12 h at 1 : 1 ratio and dry back the seeds to original seed moisture content under shade.

## Fertilizer requirement

- · As basal application NPK @ 100 : 50 : 50 kg / ha.

## Spacing

- · 45 x 10 cm.

## Pre-harvest sanitation spray

- · Spray 2 % carbendazim at ten days before harvest against black mould.

## Harvesting

- · Seeds attain physiological maturity 40 - 45 days after 50 % flowering.
- · Harvest  the  earheads  as  once  over  harvest,  when  the  seeds  have  attained  the characteristic yellow colour.

## Threshing

- · Thresh  the  earheads  either  manually  or  mechanically  at  a  moisture  content  of 15 - 18 %.

## Seed grading

- · Size grade the seeds either with 9 / 64' or depending upon the variety.

## Pre-storage seed treatment

- · Treat the seeds with carbendazim @ 2 g / kg.
- · Treat the seeds with halogen mixture @ 3 g / kg (CaOCl2 + CaCO3 + arappu ( Albizzia amara ) leaf powder mixed in the ratio of 5:4:1 as eco-friendly treatment.

## Storage

- · Store the seeds in gunny or cloth bags for short term storage (8-9 months) with a seed moisture content of 10 - 12 %.
- · Store the seeds in polylined gunny bag for medium term storage (12- 15 months) with a seed moisture content of 8 - 9 %.
- · Store  the  seeds  in  700  gauge  polythene  bag  for  long  term  storage  (more  than 15 months) with a seed moisture content less than 8 %.

## SORGHUM - HYBRID SEED PRODUCTION

## Land requirement

- · Fertile land with good drainage and irrigation facility.

- · Field should not have volunteer plants. Hence, the previous crop should not be the same or different variety / hybrid of sorghum.

## Isolation

- · For certified / quality seed production leave a distance of 200 m all around the field from same and other varieties of sorghum.

## Season

- · For increased seed set and effective synchronization, sow the crop during October November.

## Planting ratio

- · Sow the female and male parents in the ratio of 4:2 for foundation seed production and 5:2 for certified seed production

## Border rows

- · Sow the male parent in four rows around the field for the availability of adequate pollen.

## Fertilizer requirement

- · NPK @ 100: 50: 50 kg / ha.
- · Apply NPK @ 50:50:50 kg / ha as basal; 25 kg of nitrogen after first weeding and during boot leaf stage as top dressing.

## Foliar Application

- · Foliar spray of 0.5% FeSO4 at primordial initiation stage and there after two sprays at ten days interval to enhance the seed set.

## Synchronization techniques (Adopt any one of the following)

- · Apply 1 % urea at flower initiation to the delayed parent.
- · Withhold one irrigation to the advanced parent.
- · Staggering the sowing of male and female parents depending upon the hybrid and location.
- · Foliar spray of cycocel (CCC) @ 300 ppm to delay the flower formation
- · Foliar spray of growth retardant, MH @ 500 ppm at 45 DAS to the advanced parent.

## Harvesting

- · Harvest the male parent (R line) first and remove from field.
- · Harvest  the  hybrid  crop  when  90  %  of  seeds  in  the  earhead  have  attained  the characteristic yellow colour.

## Other management practices

The techniques recommended for varieties can be adapted.

## CROP MANAGEMENT

## II NURSERY

## 1. PREPARATION  OF LAND

- i. For  raising  seedlings  to  plant  one  ha  select  7.5  cents  near  a  water  source. Water  should  not stagnate.
- ii. Plough the land and bring it to the fine tilth.

## 2. APPLICATION OF FYM

Apply 750 kg of FYM or compost and incorporate by ploughing. Cover the seeds with 500 kg of FYM.

## 3. FORMING RAISED BED

- i. In  each  cent  mark  6  plots  of  the  size  3  m  x  1.5  m    with    30  cm  channel    in between  the plots and all around.
- ii. Form the channel to a depth of 15  cm.
- iii. Spread the earth excavated from the channel on the beds and  level.

NOTE: The Unit of 6 plots in one cent will form one unit for irrigation.

## 4. REMOVAL  OF  ERGOT  AFFECTED  SEEDS  AND  SCLEROTIA  TO  PREVENT  PRIMARY INFECTION

- i. Dissolve one kg of common salt in 10 litres of water.
- iii. Remove the ergot and sclerotia affected seeds which will float.
- ii. Drop the seeds into the salt  solution
- iv. Wash seeds in fresh water 2 or 3 times to remove the salt on the seeds.
- vi. Treat  the  seeds  with  three  packets  (600g)  of  the  Azospirillum  inoculant  and  3 packets (600g) of phosphobacteria or 6 packets (1200g) of azophos.
- v. Dry the seeds in shade.

## 5. TREATMENT OF THE NURSERY BED WITH INSECTICIDES

Apply phorate 10 G 180 g or Carbofuran 3 G 600 g mixed with 2 kg of moist sand, spread on the beds and work into the top 2 cm of soil to protect the seedlings from shootfly infestation.

## 6. SOWING AND COVERING THE SEEDS

- i. Open small rills not deeper than 1 cm on the bed by passing the fingers over it.
- ii. Sow 3.75 kg of seeds in 7.5 cents (0.5 kg / cent) and use increased  seed rate upto  12.5  kg    per  ha  in  shootfly  endemic  area  and  transplant  only  healthy seedlings.
- iii. Cover the seeds by smoothening out the rills with hand. Sprinkle 500 kg of FYM or compost evenly and cover the seeds completely with hands.

NOTE: Do not sow the seeds deep as germination will be affected.

## 7. IRRIGATION TO THE SEED BED

- i. Provide one inlet to each unit so as to allow water in the channels.
- ii. Allow water to enter the channel and turn off the water when the  raised  bed is completely wet.
- iii. Irrigate as per the following  schedule.

Light Soil

Heavy Soil On 3 rd day after  sowing On 9 th day after  sowing On 16 th day after  sowing

1 st

immediately after sowing Immediately after sowing

2 nd on 3 rd day after sowing

3 rd on 7 th day after sowing

4 th on 12 th day after sowing

5 th on 17 th day after  sowing

## 8. PROTECTION OF SEEDLINGS IN THE NURSERY FROM PEST ATTACK

If seed bed is not treated before sowing, protect the nursery by applying any one of the insecticides given below on the 7 th and 14 th day of sowing by mixing in 6 litres of water. Endosulfan 35 EC 12ml ; Methyl demeton 25 EC 12 ml, Dimethoat 30 EC 12 ml. Note:

- 1.  The  seedlings should not be kept in nursery for more than 18 days. Otherwise the establishment and yield will be affected adversely.
- 2. Ensure that cracks should not develop in the nursery. This can be avoided by properly adjusting the quantity of irrigation water.

## I. PREPARATION OF MAIN FIELD

## 1. FIELD PREPARATION

- i. Plough with an iron plough twice and with country plough twice. Bring the soil into fine tilth.
- ii. CHISELING  FOR  SOILS  WITH  HARD  PAN:  Chisel  the  soils  having  hard  pan formation  at  shallow  depths  with  chisel  plough  at  0.5m  interval,  first  in  one direction then in the direction perpendicular to the previous one, once in three years.

## 2. APPLICATION OF FYM OR COMPOST

Spread  12.5  t/ha  of  FYM  or  compost  or  composted  coir  pith  uniformly  on unploughed  soil.  Incorporate  the  manure  by  working  the  country  plough  and  apply Azospirillum    to    the    soil    @    10  packets  per  ha  (2000  g)  and  10  packets  (2000g)  of phosphobacteria (or) 20 packets  (4000g)  of azophos with 25kg of soil and 25 kg of FYM.

## 3. FORMING RIDGES AND FURROWS/BEDS

- i. Form ridges and furrows (using 3 ridges) 6 m long and 45 cm apart. If pulses is intercropped, form ridges and furrows 6 m long and 30 cm apart.
- ii. If ridge planting is not followed, form beds of the size 10 m  or 30 m  depending 2 2 upon water availability.
- iii. Form irrigation channels.
- iv. To conserve soil moisture under rainfed condition, sow the seeds in flat and form furrows between crop rows during intercultivation on third week after  sowing

## 4. APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS

Apply NPK fertilizers as per soil test recommendations as far as possible.  If soil test recommendation      is    not    available      follow      the    blanket      recommendation      of 70:35:35   kg  N, P2 O5, K2O/ha  for all varieties.  For  hybrids,  apply  80 kg  N, 40 kg  P O 2 5 and 40  kg  K2O per  ha.  Apply  the recommended N in three splits as 25:50:25 per cent at  0.15  and  30  DAS  and  full  dose  of  phosphorus  and  potassium  basally.  Combined application of azospirillum and phosphobacteria or azophos along with 75 per cent of the recommended level of N and P is recommended for rainfed conditions.  Apply 30 kg S basally for S deficient soils.

Method of application: For transplanted crop, open a furrow more  than  5 cm deep  on the side of the ridge (1/3 distance  from the bottom),  place the fertilizer  and cover. For the direct sown  crop, mark the lines more than 5 cm deep 45 cm apart in the beds. Place  the fertilizer  below  5 cm depth and cover upto 2 cm from the top before sowing. In the case of intercropping with pulses, mark lines more than 5 cm deep 30 cm apart in the beds. Apply fertilizer  only in the rows in which cumbu  is  to be sown and cover upto 2 cm. When azospirillum  inoculant  is used for seeds,  seedlings  use only  50 kg N/ha for variety, 60 kg N/ha for hybrid, as soil application in other words,  reduce  25% N of soil test recommendations.

Soil test crop response based integrated plant nutrition system (STCRIPNS) recommendation may  be adopted for prescribing fertilizer doses for specified yieldtargets. (ready reckoners are furnished )

## 5. APPLICATION OF MICRONUTRIENT MIXTURE

Apply 12.5 kg/ha of micronutrient mixture formulated by the Department of Agriculture. Mix the  mixture  with  enough  sand  to  make  50  kg  and  apply  on  the  surface    just  before planting/after  sowing  and cover the seeds. Broadcast the mixture on the surface of seed line (or) Apply TNAU MN mixture @ 12.5t/ha for irrigated and 7.5 kg/ha for rainfed crops as enriched  FYM  (prepare  enriched  FYM  at  1:10  ratio  of  MN  mixture  and  FYM  at  friable moisture and incubate for one month in shade). If micronutrient mixture is not available apply 25 kg of zinc sulphate per ha. Mix the chemical with enough sand to make 50 kg and apply as above. For Mn deficiency apply 12.5 kg MnSO4ha -1 basally or foliar spraying of 0.2% MnSO4 thrice can be followed.

## II. MANAGEMENT OF MAIN FIELD

## 1. TRANSPLANTING SEEDLINGS OR SOWING PRE-TREATED SEEDS Transplanted Crop

- i. Pull out the seedlings when they are 15 to 18 days old.
- ii. Adopt the spacing 45 x 15 cm for all the varieties / hybrids.
- iii. Plant  seedlings  on  the  side  of  ridge,  half  way  from  the  bottom.    Depth  of planting should  be 3  to 5 cm.
- iv. Root dipping with bio-fertilizers: Prepare the slurry with 5 packets (1000 g)/ha of Azospirillum  inoculant  and  5  packets  (1000g/ha)  of  phosphobacteria    or  10 packets    of  azophos    (2000g/ha)  in  40  lit.  of  water  and  dip  the  roots  of  the seedlings 15 - 30 minutes before planting.

## Direct sown crop

Soaking  of  cumbu  seeds  either  in  2%  Potassium  chloride  (KCl)  or    3%    Sodium Chloride (NaCl) for 16 hours followed by 5 hours shade drying improves germination and stand.

- i. Adopt the spacing of 45 x 15 cm for all varieties / hybrids. If pulse is intercropped, adopt a spacing of 30 x 15 cm for cumbu and 30 x 10 cm for pulses. One pair row of cumbu  is alternated with a single row of pulse crop.
- ii. In the furrows  in which fertilizers  have been applied,  place  5 kg of seed, allowing them to fall 4 - 5 cm apart (Use higher seed rate of 5 kg to offset mortality). The optimum  population  should be 1,45,000 per ha. Use increased seed rate upto 12.5 kg per hectare in shoot fly endemic area and remove the shootfly damaged seedlings at the time of thinning.
- iii. Where pulse seeds are to be sown, drop pulse seeds to fall 5 cm apart and cover.

## 2. WEED MANAGEMENT Transplanted crop

Spray PE Atrazine 0.25 kg/ha on 3 DAT followed by one hand weeding on 30 - 35 DAT. If herbicide is not used hand weeding twice on 15 DAT and 30 - 35 DAT.

## Direct Sown crop

- i. Apply the PE Atrazine 0.25 kg/ha on 3 DAS as spray on the soil surface using Backpack/Knapsack/Rocker sprayer fitted with flat type nozzle using 500 litres   of water/ha.
- ii. Apply herbicide when there is sufficient moisture in the soil.
- iii. Hand weeding 30 - 35 DAT if pre-emergence herbicide is  applied.
- iv. If pre-emergence herbicide is not applied hand weeding twice on 15 and 30 DAT.

## 3. THINNING AND GAP FILLING

In direct sown crop after 1st weeding at the time of irrigation, gap fill and thin the crop to a spacing of 15 cm between plants; cowpea crop to 20 cm between plants and other pulses crops to 10  cm between plants.

## 4. TOP DRESSING OF FERTILIZERS

- i. Top dress the nitrogen at 15 and 30 days after transplanting or direct sowing.
- ii. In transplanted crop, open a furrow 5 cm deep with a stick or hoe at the bottom of the furrow, place the fertilizer and  cover.
- iii. In the case of direct sown crop apply the fertilizer in band. If intercropped  with pulses apply  the fertilizer to cumbu crop  only.
- iv. After the application of fertilizer, irrigate the crop.

NOTE: This is only a guideline and the irrigation schedule is to be adjusted depending upon the prevailing weather conditions.

## IV. HARVESTING THE CROP

## 1. SYMPTOMS OF MATURITY

- i. Leaves will turn yellow and present a dried appearance.
- ii. Grains will be hardened.

## 2. HARVESTING

- i. Cut the earheads separately.
- ii. Cut the straw after a week, allowing it to dry and stack it in the field till it can be transported.

## 3. THRESHING, CLEANING, DRYING AND STORING

- i. Dry the earheads
- ii. Thresh in a mechanical thresher or
- iii. Spread it and drag a stone roller over it or

- iv. Cattle thresh.
- v. Dry the seeds below 10 per cent and mix 100 kg of grains with 1kg of activated kaolin to reduce the rice weevil and rice moth incidence.
- vi. Spray  Malathion  50EC  10  ml/  lit  @  3  lit  of  spray  fluid/100  m   over  the  bags 2 during storage godowns,
- vii. For grain purpose the grain should be dried well below 10% moisture and stored in gunny bags.

## CROP PROTECTION

## Protection of seedlings in the nursery from pest attack

If seed bed is not treated before sowing, protect the nursery by applying any one of the insecticides given below on the 7 th and 14 th day of sowing by mixing in 6 litres of water; Methyl  demeton 25 EC 12 ml, Dimethoate 30 EC 12 ml.

Note:

- 1. The seedlings should not be kept in nursery for more than 18 days. Otherwise the establishment and yield will be affected adversely.
- 2. Ensure that cracks should not develop in the nursery. This can be avoided by properly adjusting the quantity of irrigation water.

## CUMBU (PEARL MILLET) - VARIETAL SEED PRODUCTION

## Land requirement

- · Land should be free of volunteer plants. The previous crop should not be the same variety  or  other  varieties  of  the  same  crop.  It  can  be  the  same  variety,  if  it  is certified as per the procedures of certification agency.

## Isolation

- · For certified / quality seed production leave a distance of 200 m all around the field from the same and other varieties of pearl millet.

## Season

- · October - December and June - September.

## Pre-sowing seed treatment

- · Soak the seeds in 2 % KCl for 16 h at 1:1 ratio and dry back the seeds to original seed  moisture  content  (8  -  9  %)  under  shade.  This  can  be  adapted  both  for  the garden and dry land ecosystem.

## Fertilizer requirement

- · Apply NPK @ 100 : 50 : 50 kg / ha.
- · Apply NPK @ 50 :50:50 kg / ha as basal and 50 kg N on 30 days after sowing as top dressing.

## Spacing

- · 45 x 20 cm.

## Foliar spray

- · Spray 1 % DAP at peak tillering stage to increase seed filling.

## Harvesting

- · Seeds attain physiological maturity at 27 - 30 days after 50 % flowering.
- · Harvest the earheads when the seed attained the characteristic pale green colour, as once over harvest at 20 - 25 % moisture content.
- · Harvest the crop two times when the tillers number is more.
- · Earheads from late-formed tillers (after 7 earheads from first formed tillers) should not be selected for seed purpose.

## Threshing

- · Thresh  the  earheads  either  manually  or  mechanically  at  moisture  content  of 15 - 20%.

## Drying

- · Dry  the  seeds  either  under  sun  or  using  mechanical  hot  air  driers  to  reduce  the moisture content to 10%.

## Seed grading

- · Grade the seeds with 4 / 64' (or) 5 / 64' round perforated metal sieve for grading.

## Pre-storage seed treatment

- · Treat the seeds with carbendazim @ 2 g / kg of seed (or)
- · Treat the seeds with halogen mixture @ 3 g / kg (CaOCl2 + CaCO3 + arappu ( Albizzia amara ) leaf powder mixed in the ratio of 5:4:1) as eco-friendly treatment.

## Storage

- · Store the seeds in gunny or cloth bags for short term storage (8 - 9 months) with a seed moisture content of 10 - 12 %.
- · Store the seeds in polylined gunny bag for medium term storage (12 - 15 months) with a seed moisture content of 8 - 9 %.
- · Store  the  seeds  in  700  gauge  polythene  bag  for  long  term  storage  (more  than 15 months) with a seed moisture content less than 8 %.

## CUMBU (PEARL MILLET) - HYBRID SEED PRODUCTION

## Land requirement

- · Select fertile land with good drainage and irrigation facilities.
- · Field should not have volunteer plants. Hence, the previous crop should not be the same or different variety / hybrid of pearl millet.

## Isolation

- · All around the field, leave 200 m distance from same and other varieties / hybrids of pearl millet.

## Season

- · October - November and June - July.

## Spacing

- · 45 x 20 cm.

## Planting ratio

- · Sow the female and male lines in the ratio of 8 : 2 to 12 : 2 depending upon the hybrids.

## Fertilizer requirement

- · Apply NPK @ 120:60:60 kg / ha as basal application.

## Foliar spray

- · Spray 2 % DAP at peak tillering stage for enhanced seed set.

## Synchronization techniques

- · Stagger  the  sowing  of  male  and  female  parents  depending  upon  the  hybrid  and location.

## Harvesting

- · Harvest the male parent (R line) first and remove from the field.
- · Harvest  the  hybrid  crop  when  90  %  seeds  on  the  ear  head  have  attained  the characteristic pale green colour.

## CROP MANAGEMENT

## I. PREPARATION OF NURSERY (IRRIGATED TRANSPLANTED  CROP)

## 1. PREPARATION OF LAND

- i. For raising seedlings to plant one ha of main field, select 12.5 cents (500 m  ) of 2 nursery area near a water source, where water does not stagnate.
- ii. Mix 37.5 kg of super phosphate with 500 kg of FYM or compost  and spread the mixture  evenly on the nursery area.
- iii. Plough two or three times with a mould board plough or five times with a country plough.

## 2. FORMING RAISED BED

- i. Mark units of 6 plots each of size 3 m x 1.5 m. Provide 30 cm space between plots for  irrigation.
- ii. Excavate the soil from the interspace and all around to a depth of 15 cm to  form channels  and spread the soil removed from the channels on the bed and level.

## 3. PRE-TREATMENT OF THE SEEDS WITH FUNGICIDES

- i. Seed treatment with Azospirillum  may be done @ 3 packets/ha  (600 g/ha) and 3 packets  (600 g/ha) of Phosphobacteria or 6 packets of Azophos (1200  g/ha).
- ii. Mix the seeds in a polythene bag to ensure a uniform coating of seeds with Thiram 4 g/ kg or Captan 4 g/kg or Carbendazim 2 g/kg of seeds.

## 4. SOWING AND COVERING THE SEEDS

- i. Make shallow rills not deeper than one cm on the beds by passing the fingers vertically over them.

- ii. Broadcast 5 kg of treated hand seeds evenly on the beds.
- iii. Cover the seeds by the hand lightly over the soil.
- iv. Sprinkle 500 kg of powdered FYM over the beds evenly to cover the seeds  which are  exposed and compact the surface lightly.

NOTE: Do not sow the seeds deep as germination will be adversely affected.

## 5. WATER MANAGEMENT

- i. Provide one inlet to each nursery unit.
- ii. Allow water to enter so as to cover all the channels around the bed. Allow the water in the channel to raise till the raised beds are fully wet and then cut off water.
- iii. Adjust the frequency of irrigation according to the soil type.

## NOTE:

- 1. One irrigation is given on the 3rd day in the case of red soil to soften the  hard  crust formed on  the soil surface and also to facilitate seedlings to emerge out.
- 2.         Do not allow cracks to develop in the nursery bed by properly adjusting the quantity of

irrigation  water.

## 6. PULLING OUT THE SEEDLINGS FOR PLANTING

Pull out seedlings on the 17th to 20th day of sowing for planting.

## II. PREPARATION OF MAIN FIELD

## 1. PLOUGHING THE FIELD

Plough twice with mould board plough or thrice with wooden plough till a good tilth  is  obtained.

## 2. APPLICATION OF FYM OR COMPOST

Spread  12.5  t/ha  of  FYM  or  compost  or  composted  coir  pith  evenly  on  the unploughed  field and then plough and incorporate in the soil. NOTE: Do not spread and leave the manure uncovered in the field as nutrients will be lost.

## 3. APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS

In soils having high intensive cropping system viz., Ragi-Maize-Cowpea,  having  high  soil available K (310 kg/ha) potassium need not be applied.

- · If soil test recommendation is not available, adopt a blanket recommendation of 60 kg N, 30 kg  P2 O5 and 30 kg K2O per  ha.
- · Apply  half  the  dose  of  N  and  full  dose  of  P O   basally  before  sowing  and  the 2 5 remaining  50%  in  two  equal  splits  at  25-30  and  40-45  days  after  sowing  is recommended.
- · Broadcast  the  fertilizer  mixture  over  the  field  before  the  last  ploughing  and incorporate into the soil by working a country  plough.

Soil test crop response based integrated plant nutrition system (STCRIPNS) recommendation  may be adopted for prescribing fertilizer doses for specified yield targets. (ready  reckoners are furnished )

NOTE: The irrigation schedule is given only as a general guideline. Regulate irrigation depending  upon the prevailing weather conditions and receipt of rain.

## V. HARVESTING

## 1. DECIDE WHEN TO HARVEST

- i. Ragi crop does not mature uniformly and hence the harvest is to be taken up in

two stages.

- ii. When the earhead on the main shoot and 50% of the earheads on the crop turn brown, the crop is ready for the first  harvest.

## 2. HARVEST OF THE CROP First harvest

- i. Cut all earheads which have turned brown.
- ii. Dry, thresh and clean the grains by winnowing.

## Second Harvest

- i. Seven days after the first harvest, cut all the earheads including the green ones.
- ii. Cure the grains to obtain maturity by heaping the harvested earheads in shade for one day without drying, so that the humidity and temperature increase and the grains get cured.
- iii. Dry, thresh and clean the grains by winnowing and store the grains in gunnies.

## Threshing

Green earheads if harvested will contaminate the seeds with immature seeds and interfere  cleaning,  drying  and  grading.  Dry  earheads  until  seed  moisture  content reaches  15%  and  separate  manually  by  threshing  with  bamboo  stick  or  machine thresher.

## Precleaning and drying

Threshed  seeds  should  be  precleaned  before  sundrying,  seeds  must  be  dried  to 12% moisture content before grading.

## Protection from storage pests

- 1. Grain purpose: Dry the seeds adequately to reduce the moisture level to 10%.
- 2. Seed purpose: Admix one kg of Activated kaolin or Malathion 5% D for every 100 kg of seed. Pack in gunny or polythene lined gunny bags for storage.

## Special problems

- i. Root  Aphids:  Mix  Dimethoate  3  ml  in  one  litre  of  water  and  drench  the rhizosphere of the infested and surrounding plants with the insecticidal  solution.
- ii. Rainfed ragi: Azospirillum mixed with FYM and applied to field saves the cost of nitrogen by 50% with a comparable yield obtained with 40 kg N/ha.
- iii. Management of aged seedlings of ragi under rainfed conditions: When  planting ragi seedlings beyond 21 days, increase the number of seedlings to 3/hill and increase N level by 25% to minimise yield  loss.
- iv. Apply VAM culture ( Glomus fasciculatum )  at  100  g/m   in  the  nursery  and  also 2 treat with Azospirillum and Phosphobacterium as seed treatment, seedling dip and field application to reduce the reniform nematode population in  ragi.

## RAGI : RAINFED

## Rainfall

Average and well distributed rainfall of 450-500 mm is optimum for rainfed ragi

## Season

Finger  millet  is  grown  in  different  seasons  in  different  parts  of  the  country.  As  a  rainfed crop, it is  normally  sown  in  June-  July  in  Tamil  Nadu.  It  also  grown  in  winter  season  (rabi)  by planting in September - October in Tamil Nadu and as a summer irrigated crop by planting January - February.

## Tillage

Fall ploughing is advantageous for moisture conservation. In the month of April or May, one deep ploughing with mould board plough followed by ploughing with wooden plough  twice is    necessary.  Before  sowing  secondary  tillage  with  cultivator  and  multiple  tooth  hoe  to prepare smooth seed bed is necessary.

## Seed rate and planting

A plant population of 4 - 5 lakhs per ha is optimum for getting higher yields  and  higher  or lower population than the optimum will reduce the yield. Line sowing is ideal and seed drills giving spacing of 22.5 - 30 cm between rows should be used. Finger millet seeds are very small  (400 seeds/g) and the recommended seed rate is 10 kg/ha. Therefore, even when seed  drill  is  used thinning within the row leaving a spacing of 7.5 - 10 cm between plants, must be followed.

Sowing  by  seed-cum-fertilizer  drill  is  advantageous  for  line  sowing    besides    efficient utilization of applied nutrients.

Maintenance of optimum plant population is an important prerequisite for getting higher yield under rainfed conditions. Poor germination, often, is the result of inadequate moisture after  sowing  in    low  rainfall  areas.  Under  these  conditions,  the  adoption  of  a  simple technique  like  seed  hardening  will    not  only  improve  germination  and  subsequent  plant stand but also impart early seedling vigour and tolerance to drought.

The procedure of seed hardening technique is as follows.

- 1. Sole  seeds  in  water  for  6  hours.  Use  one  litre  water  for  every  kg  seed  for soaking.
- 2. Drain the water and keep the seeds in wet cloth bag tightly tied for two days.
- 3. At this stage, the seeds will show initial signs of germination.
- 4. Remove seeds from the wet cloth bag and dry them in shade on a dry cloth for 2 days.
- 5. Use the above hardened seeds for sowing.

## Manuring and fertilization

Finger millet responds well to fertilizer application especially to N and P. The recommended doses  of  fertilizers  vary  from  state  to  state  for  rainfed  crop.  Recommended  dose    of 40:20:20  kg/ha N:P:K was applied. With judicious application of farmyard manure inorganic fertilizer efficiency is enhanced.  Entire P2O5  and K2O are to be applied at sowing,  whereas nitrogen is to be applied in two  or three split doses depending upon moisture availability. In areas of good rainfall and moisture availability, 50% of recommended nitrogen is to be applied at sowing and the remaining 50% in two equal splits at 25-30 and 40-45 days after sowing.  In areas of uncertain  rainfall,  50% at sowing  and  the remaining 50% around 35 days after sowing is recommended.

## Bio-fertilizers

Treating seeds with Azospirillum brasilense (N fixing bacterium) and Aspergillus awamori (P solubilizing fungs) @ 25 g/kg seed is beneficial. In case seeds are to be treated with seed dressing chemicals,  treat the seeds first with seed dressing  chemicals  and then with biofertilizers  at the time   of sowing.

## Procedures for inoculating seeds with biofertilizers

- 1. Bio-fertilizer culture specific to the crop is to be used @ 25 g per kg of  seed.
- 2. Sticker  solution  is  necessary  for  effective  seed  inoculation.  This    can    be prepared  by  dissolving 25 g jaggery or sugar in 250 ml water and boiling for 5 minutes. The solution thus prepared is  cooled.
- 3. Smear the seeds well using the required quantity of sticker solution. Then add culture to the seeds and mix thoroughly so as to get a fine coating of culture on the  seed.
- 4. The culture-coated seeds is to be dried well in shade to avoid clumping of seeds.
- 5. Use the inoculated seeds for sowing.

## Weed control

- i. In  line  sown  crop  2-3  inter-cultivations  are  necessary.  In  assured  rainfall  and irrigated  areas  spraying  2,4-D  sodium  salt  @  0.75  kg.a.i./ha  as  post-emergent spray on 20-25 days after  sowing effectively controls weeds.
- ii. Apply, Isoproturon @ 0.5 a.i/ha as pre-emergence on 3 DAS is also effective in control of  weeds. In broadcast crop two effective hand weedings will  minimize weeds  as  inter cultivations is not possible.
- iii. For direct sown  rainfed  ragi post-emergence  application  of 2, 4 D Na salt  (or) EE formulation at 0.5 kg ha -1 applied on 10 days after sowing and at 0.75 kg ha -1 applied on 15 days after sowing will give effective weed control as well as higher grain  yield.

## Cropping systems Crop rotation

Rotation with legumes like greengram / blackgram / field bean / soybean / horse gram or ground nut in southern state will minimize inorganic fertilizer application  and  also  sustain higher  yields.

## Intercropping

Finger millet based inter cropping system with pigeon pea at 4:1 ratio is recommended for rainfed situation to obtain high grain yield

## RAGI (FINGER MILLET) - VARIETAL SEED PRODUCTION

## Land Requirement

- · Land should be free of volunteer plants. The previous crop should not be the same variety or other varieties of the same crop. It can be the same variety if it is certified as per the procedures of certification agency.

## Isolation

- · For certified / quality seed production leave a distance of 3 m all around the field from the same and other varieties of the finger millet.

## Pre-sowing seed treatment

- · Soak the seeds in 0.5 % CaCl2 for 6 h at 1:1 ratio and dry back the seeds to original seed moisture content (8 - 9 %) under shade. This can be adapted both for the garden and dry land ecosystem.
- · Treat the graded seed with carbendazim @ 2 g / kg of seed.

## Nursery sowing

- · In  raised  bed,  sow  the  seeds  not  deeper  than  1  cm  and  sprinkle  with  200  kg  of powdered FYM. Lightly level and compact the surface of nursery.

## Harvesting

- · Harvest the crop in 2 harvests.
- · First harvest should be taken up when 50 % of seeds in the ear-heads have attained the characteristic brown colour.
- · Second harvest should be taken up a week to ten days after first havest, when all the remaining earheads turned brown (spikelets are non-shattering).

## Threshing

- · Dry the earheads until the seed moisture content is reduced to 15 % and seeds are separated manually by threshing with pliable bamboo stick or machine thresher.
- · Pre-clean the threshed seeds before sun drying.
- · Dry the seeds to 12 % moisture content before grading.

## Seed grading

- · Grade  the  seeds  either  with  BSS  10  x  10  or  BSS  12  x  12  depending  upon  the variety.

## Pre-storage seed treatment

- · Treat the seeds with carbendazim @ 2 g / kg of seed.

## Storage

- · Store the seeds in gunny or cloth bags for short term storage (8 - 9 months) with a seed moisture content of 10 to 12 %.
- · Store the seeds in polylined gunny bag for medium term storage (12 - 15 months) with a seed moisture content of 8 to 9 %.
- · Store  the  seeds  in  700  gauge  polythene  bag  for  long  term  storage  (more  than 15 months) with a seed moisture content less than 8 %.

## CROP MANAGEMENT

## i. IRRIGATED MAIZE

## 1. APPLICATION OF FYM OR COMPOST

Spread  12.5  t/ha  of  FYM  or  compost  or  composted  coir  pith  evenly  on  the unploughed field along with 10 packets of Azospirillum (2000 g/ha) and incorporate in the soil.

## 2. FIELD PREPARATION

Plough the field  with  disc  plough  once  followed  by  cultivator  ploughing  twice, after spreading FYM or compost till a fine tilth is obtained.

## 3. FORMING RIDGES AND FURROWS OR BEDS

Form ridges and furrows providing sufficient irrigation channels. The ridges should

be 6 m long and 60 cm apart.

If ridges and furrows are not made, form beds of size 10 m  or 20 m  depending on 2 2 the availability of water.

Use a bund former or ridge plough to economise cost of  production.

## 4. APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS

- i. Soil test crop response based integrated plant nutrition system (STCR- IPNS) I If soil  test  recommendation  is  not  available  adopt  a  blanket  recommendation  of 135:62.5:50 Kg/NPK ha -1 for varieties and 250:75:75 kg NPK ha -1 for hybrid maize
- ii. Apply quarter of the dose of N; full dose of P2O5 and K2O basally before  sowing.
- iii. In the case of ridge planted crop, open a furrow 6 cm deep on the side of the ridge, at two thirds the distance from the top of the ridge.
- iv. Apply the fertilizer mixture along the furrows evenly and cover to a depth of 4 cm with soil.
- v. If bed system  of planting  is followed,  open furrows  6 cm deep at a distance of 60 cm apart.
- vi. Place the fertilizer  mixture along the furrows evenly and cover to a depth of 4 cm with soil.

Soil test crop response based integrated plant nutrition system (STCRIPNS) recommendation may be adopted for prescribing fertilizer doses for specified yield targets. (ready  reckoners are furnished )

| Magnesium deficiency  | :   | Older leaves are the first to become chlorotic at margins and  between veins. Streaked appearance of leaves. Necrotic or  chlorotic spots seen in leaves.                                             |
| Zinc deficiency       | :   | Older leaves have yellow streaks or chlorotic striping between  veins. In several cases, unfolding of young leaves, which may be  white or yellow.                                                    |
| Iron deficiency       | :   | Interveinal chlorosis. The entire crop may exhibit bleached  appearance.                                                                                                                              |

## 5. APPLICATION OF MICRONUTRIENT

- i. 12.5 kg of micronutrient mixture formulated by the Department of Agriculture, Tamil  Nadu,  mixed  with  sand  to  make  a  total  quantity  of  50  kg/ha  is  to  be applied. (or)
- ii. Apply TNAU MN mixture @ 30 kg/ha as enriched FYM (Prepare enriched FYM at 1:10 ratio MN mixture and FYM; mix at friable moisture and incubate for one month in shade.
- iii. Apply zinc sulphate @ 37.5 kg ha -1 for hybrid maize and 25 kg ha -1 for varieties can be followed in Zn deficient soils.
- iv. Apply 50 kg FeSO4 + 12.5 t FYM ha -1 along with 40 kg S as elemental sulphur for calcareous soils. Apply the mixture over the furrows and two thirds in the top of ridges, if ridge planting is followed.  If bed system of sowing is followed, apply the micronutrient mixture over the beds.
- v. Apply 40 kg S, 10 kg borax and 50 kg FeSO4 + 12.5 t FYM for specific respective nutrient deficiency in soils.
- vi. For zinc and iron deficiencies in plants foliar spraying 0.5% ZnSO4, 1% FeSO4 + 0.1% citric acid thrice on 30, 40 and 50 days after sowing can be followed.

## 6. SEED RATE

Select  good  quality  seeds  and  adopt  the  seed  rate  of  20  kg/ha  for  CO  1  and TNAU Maize Hybrid CO 6 and 25 kg /ha for COBC 1.

## 7. SPACING

Adopt  a  spacing  of  25  cm  between  plants  in  the  rows  which  are  60  cm  apart. Population : For varieties and hybrids 6 - 7 plants / sq. m. and For baby corn, 8 - 9 plants / sq. m.

## 8. SEED TREATMENT

Step 1: Use pelleted seeds with insecticides (treat one kg of seeds with Chlorpyriphos 20EC or Monocrotophos 36 WSC or Phosalone 35 EC @ 4 ml + 0.5 gram gum  in 20 ml of water)  for  the  control of stem borer or seed treatment with imidacloprid 70 WS 10 g/kg of seeds.

Step 2: Seed treatment with Metalaxyl or Thiram @ 2 g/kg of seed for the control of downy  mildew  and crazy top

- Step 3 : Seeds treated with fungicides may be treated with three packets (600 g/ha) of Azospirillum before sowing.

## 9. SOWING

- i. Dibble  the  seeds  at  a  depth  of  4  cm  along  the  furrow  in  which  fertilizers  are placed and cover with soil.
- ii. Put one seed per hole if the germination is assured otherwise put two seeds per hole

## 10. WEED MANAGEMENT

- i. Apply  Atrazine  @  0.50  -  0.75  kg/ha  as  pre-emergence  on  3-5  DAS  using Backpack/  Knapsack/ Rocker sprayer fitted with a flat fan nozzle using 500 litres of water/ha followed by one hand weeding on 30-35 DAS.  (or)
- ii. Apply Atrazine @ 0.50 kg/ha as pre-emergence on 3-5 DAS followed by 2,4-D @ 1 kg/ha on 20-25 DAS, using Backpack/Knapsack/Rocker sprayer fitted with a flat fan nozzle using 500 litres of water/ha.
- iii. In line sown crop, apply PE Atrazine @ 0.50 kg/ha on 3-5 DAS followed by Twin Wheel hoe weeder weeding on 30-35 DAS.
- iv. Apply herbicide when there is sufficient moisture in the soil.
- v. Do not disturb the soil after herbicide application.
- vi. If pulse crop is to be raised as intercrop, do not use Atrazine. Spray Pendimethalin  @0.75  kg/ha as pre emergence on 3-5 DAS.

## 11. THINNING AND GAP FILLING

- i. If two seeds were sown, leave only one healthy and vigorous  seedling  per hole and remove  the other on the 12-15 days after sowing.
- ii. Where seedlings have not germinated, dibble presoaked  seeds  at the rate  of 2 seeds  per  hole and immediately  irrigate.

## 12. HOEING, HAND-WEEDING AND EARTHING UP

- i. Hoe and hand-weed on the 30th day of sowing.
- ii. Earth up and form new ridges so that the plants come  directly  on the top of the ridges.  This  will provide additional anchorage to the plants.

## 13. TOP DRESSING WITH NITROGEN

- i. Place half of the dose of N on the 25 th day of sowing along the furrows evenly and cover it with soil.
- ii. Place the remaining quarter of N on the 45 th day of sowing

## 14. WATER MANAGEMENT

Maize crop is  sensitive  to  both  moisture  stress  and  excessive  moisture,  hence regulate  irrigation  according  to  the  requirement.  Ensure  optimum  moisture availability during the most critical phase (45 to 65 days after sowing); otherwise yield will be reduced by a considerable extent.

Regulate  irrigation  according  to  the  following  growth  phase  of  the  crop.

Germination  &amp; establishment phase

1 to 14 days

Vegetative phase

15 to 39 days

Flowering phase

40 to 65 days

Maturity phase

66 to 95 days

## HARVESTING STAGE OF HARVEST

Observe the following symptoms, taking into consideration the average duration of the crop.

- i. The sheath covering the cob will turn yellow and dry at maturity.
- ii. The seeds become fairly hard and dry. At this stage the crop is ready for harvest.

## HARVESTING THE CROP

- i. Tear off the cob sheath by using the gunny needle and remove  the cobs from the plant.
- ii. Carry out harvest operations at a single stage for easy transportation.

## THRESHING THE COBS

- i. Dry the cobs under the sun till the grains are dry.
- ii. Use mechanical threshers or by running the tractor over dried cobs to separate the grains  from the shank.
- iii. Clean the seeds by  winnowing
- iv. Collect and store the dry grains in gunnies.

## STACKING THE STRAW FOR FEEDING CATTLE

- i. Maize straw can also be used as a good cattle feed when it is green.
- ii. Harvest the crop and cut the green straw into bits with a chaff cutter or chopping knife  and  feed the cattle.

## I. RAINFED MAIZE

## 1. FIELD PREPARATION

Chisel the soil having hard pan formation at shallow depths with chisel plough at 0.5 m interval first in one direction and then in the direction perpendicular to the previous  one  once  in  three  years.  Apply  12.5  t/ha  of  FYM  or  compost  or composted coir pith besides  chiselling,  to  get  an additional yield of about 30% over control.

## 2. APPLICATION OF FYM OR COMPOST

Spread  12.5  t/ha  of  FYM  or  compost  or  composted  coir  pith  evenly  on  the unploughed field along with 10 packets of Azospirillum (2000 g/ha) and incorporate in the soil.

## 3. APPLICATION OF FERTILIZER

- i. Apply  NPK  as  per  soil  test  recommendation  as  far  as  possible.  If  soil  test recommendation is not available, adopt a blanket recommendation of 60 : 30 : 30 NPK kg/ha for Alfisols and 40 : 20 : 0 NPK kg/ha for Vertisols.
- ii. Apply half  of  N  and  full  dose  of  P   O   and  K   O  with  enriched  FYM  as  basal 2 5 2 along  with Azospirillum (10 packets/ha).
- iii. Top dress remaining half of N at tasseling.
- Soil  test  crop  response  based  integrated  plant  nutrition  system  (STCR-  IPNS) recommendation may be adopted for prescribing fertilizer doses for specified yieldtargets. (ready reckoners are furnished )

Adopt  a  spacing  of  45  cm  between  rows  and  20  cm  between  plants  in  the  row. Population : 10 - 11plants/m 2

## 6. PRE-TREATMENT OF SEEDS WITH BIOFERTILIZER

Seeds  treated  with  fungicides  may  be  treated  with  three  packets  (600  g/ha)  of Azospirillum

## 7. SOWING

Dibble or drill the seeds at a depth of 4 cm.

## 8. CROPPING SYSTEMS

- i. Intercropping system of maize + cowpea or maize  + blackgram  is recommended for higher net returns in the red lateritic soils of Southern districts.
- ii. For  Vertisols  of  Southern  district,  maize  +  redgram  intercropping  systems  is ideal.

## CROP PHYSIOLOGY

Foliar spray of TNAU Maize Maxim @ 3 kg/acre  in 200 litres of water at tassel initiation    and    at  grain  filling  stages  improves  grain  filling,  grain  yield  and  drought tolerance.

## MAIZE - VARIETAL SEED PRODUCTION

## Land requirement

- · Land should be free from volunteer plants. The previous crop should not be the same variety or other varieties of the same crop. It can be the same variety if it is certified as per the procedures of certification agency.

## Isolation

- · For certified seed production, leave a distance of 200 m all around the field from the same and other varieties of maize.

## Pre-sowing seed management

- · Soak the seed in 4 % Pseudomonas fluorescens for 8 h at 1 : 1 ratio and dry back the seeds to original seed moisture content under shade.

## Season

- · June - September and November - February.

## Spacing

- · 45 x 10 cm.

## Fertilizer requirement

- · The  crop  requires  NPK  @  150:75:75  kg  /  ha.  Apply  NPK  @  40:75:40  kg  /  ha  as basal, 50 kg N at 20 days after sowing and 60:0:35 kg NPK at 40 days after sowing.

## Harvest

- · Harvest the cobs as once over harvest.
- · Verify true to type cobs based on kernel and shank colour (cob sorting) variations.
- · Remove the diseased cobs.

## Shelling

- · Shell the cobs either by beating with pliable bamboo stick or using maize sheller with required rpm at a seed moisture content of 15 - 18 %.
- · Improper shelling leads to pericarp injury up to 48 % and will promote saprophytic fungal growth.
- · Estimate  mechanical  /  pericarp  injury  through  20  %  FeCl3  test  or  using  0.25  % Tetrazolium chloride solution.

## Size grading

- · Grade the seeds using  18 / 64' round perforated sieves.

## Pre-storage seed treatment

- · Treat the seeds with carbendazim @ 2 g / kg of seed using 5 ml of water / kg of seed.
- · Dry dress the seeds with halogen mixture @ 3 g / kg of seed (CaOCl2 + CaCO3 + arappu ( Albizzia amara ) leaf powder mixed in the ratio of 5:4:1 for grain cum seed

## storage.

## Storage

- · Store the seeds in gunny or cloth bags for short term storage (8 - 9 months) with a seed moisture content of 10 to 12 %.
- · Store the seeds in polylined gunny bag for medium term storage (12 - 15 months) with a seed moisture content of 8 - 9 %.
- · Store  the  seeds  in  700  gauge  polythene  bag  for  long  term  storage  (more  than 15 months) with a seed moisture content less than 8 %.

## MAIZE - HYBRID SEED PRODUCTION

## Land requirement

- · Select fertile land with good drainage and irrigation.
- · Field should not have volunteer plants. Hence, the previous crop should not be the same or different variety / hybrid of maize.

## Isolation

- · All around the field leave 200 m distance from same and other varieties / hybrids of maize.

## Pre-sowing seed treatment

- · Coat the seed with polymer @ 6 g / kg + carbendazim @ 2 g / kg + imidachloprid @ 1 ml / kg + micronutrient mixture @ 3 ml / kg of seed.

## Spacing

- · 60 x 25 cm.

## Planting ratio

- · Sow the female and male parents in the ratio of 6 : 2.

## Border rows

- · Sow four rows of male parent all around the field for effective pollination.

## Fertilizer requirement

- · Apply NPK @ 150: 75: 75 kg / ha in split applications. Three split application 25 kg of  N  at  vegetative,at  5%  flowering  and  10  days  after  second  application.  Apply 18.75 kg of K in two split application at 5% flowering and maturity stages.

## Foliar spray

- · Spray ZnSO4 0.5 % + boric acid 0.2 % at 50 % flowering stage to enhance the seed set.

3. SEED RATE:

100 kg/ha

## CROP MANAGEMENT

## 1. FIELD PREPARATION

Plough twice with an iron plough and two to three times with cultivator and prepare the land to a fine tilth.

## 2. APPLICATION OF FYM OR COMPOST

Spread 12.5 t/ha of FYM or compost on the unploughed field and incorporate in the soil.

## 3. SEED TREATMENT WITH FUNGICIDES

Treat the seeds with Carbendazim or Thiram at 2 g/kg of seeds 24 hours before sowing

## 4. FORMING BEDS AND CHANNEL

Form beds size on 10 m  or 20 m . The irrigation channels are to be provided 2 2 sufficiently.

## 5. APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS

- (i) If soil test recommendation is not available, adopt a blanket recommendation of 80:40:40 NPK kg/ha. Apply 37.5 kg ZnSO4, 40 kg S basally for soils having Zn and S deficiencies.
- 5 (ii) Apply half of N and full dose of P2 O5 and K2 O basally before sowing and incorporate in the sowing line.

Soil test crop response based integrated plant nutrition system (STCRIPNS) recommendation  may  be  adopted  for  prescribing  fertilizer    doses    for    specified    yield targets. (ready reckoners are furnished )

## 6. SOWING

Draw the lines 20 cm apart and sow the seeds continuously after application of fertilizers to a depth of 5 cm. Avoid deep  sowing.

## 7. WEED MANAGEMENT

- i. Spray PE Isoproturon 500 g/ha as pre-emergence spray on 3 DAS followed by one  hand weeding on 35 th DAS.
- ii. If herbicide is not applied, give two hand weedings on 20 th and 35 th DAS.

## 8. WATER MANAGEMENT

The crop requires 4 - 6 irrigations depending on the soil type and rainfall. Wheat crop requires minimum of 5 irrigations at the following critical stages.

I = Immediately after sowing

II

= Crown root intiation : 15-20 DAS III =Active tillering stage : 35-40  DAS

IV= Flowering stage

: 50-55 DAS

V= Grain filling stage

: 70-75 DAS

Crown root initiation and flowering are the most critical stages. Water

stagnation should be avoided at the time of germination.

## 9. TOP DRESSING

Apply remaining half of N at crown root initiation stage (15-20 DAS).

## 10. HARVESTING

Harvest the crop when the grains become hard and straw becomes dry and brittle. Thresh and winnow the grains. Use mechanical threshers to reduce the cost of threshing and winnowing.

## CROP PROTECTION

Seed treatment: Treat the seed with any one of the following fungicides Carbendazim @ 2 g/kg of seed, Thiram @ 2 g/kg of seed or Carboxin @ 2 g/kg of  seed.

## III. MANAGEMENT OF FIELD OPERATION

## 1. PREPARATION OF THE LAND

Prepare the land to fine tilth and apply 12.5 t FYM/ha or composted  coir pith at the time of  last ploughing and form ridges and furrows

## 2. SEED TREATMENT

Treat  the  seeds  with  Carbendazim  or  Thiram  @  2  g/kg  of  seed  24  hours  before sowing  (or)  with    talc  formulation  of Trichoderma  viride @  4g/kg  of  seed  (or) Pseudomonas  fluorescens @ 10  g/kg seed. Bio control  agents  are  compatible  with biofertilizers.  First  treat  the  seeds  with  biocontrol  agents  and  then  with  rhizobium. Fungicides and biocontrol agents are incompatible.

## 3. TREATMENT OF THE SEEDS WITH BIOFERTILIZER

- a) Fungicide  (or)  bio  control  agents  treated  seeds  should  be  again  treated  with bacterial culture after 24 hours. Treat the seeds required for sowing 1 ha with 200g  each  of  Rhizobial  culture  CPR6  /  CPR  9,  phosphobacteria  and  PGPR ( Pseudomonas sp.) using rice gruel, shade dry it before sowing.  (or) Treat one hectare of seeds with 25 g each of powder formulation of Rhizobium and AM fungi using binder (polymer), shade dry before sowing.
- b) If seed  treatment  is  not  carried  out,  apply  2  kg  each  Rhizobial  culture, Phosphobacteria and PGPR ( Pseudomonas sp.) with 25 kg of FYM and 25 kg of sand, mix uniformly before sowing.

## 4. APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS

If soil test is not done, apply fertilizers basally before sowing

- a) Apply fertilizers basally before  sowing.
- Rainfed : 12.5 kg N + 25 kg P2O5 + 12.5 kg K2O +10 kg S*/ha Irrigated : 25 kg N
- + 50 kg P2O5 + 25 kg K2O + 20 kg S*/ha
- *Note : Applied in the form of gypsum if Single Super Phospate is not applied as a source of phosphorus
- b)  Soil application of 25 kg ZnSO4/ha under irrigated condition
- c) Soil  application  of  TNAU  micronutrient  mixture  @  5  kg/ha  as  Enriched  FYM (Prepare  enriched  FYM  at  1:10  ratio  of  MN  mixture  &amp;  FYM  ;  mix  at  friable  moisture &amp;incubate for one month in shade).

## d) Foliar spraying to mitigate moisture stress

Foliar  spraying  of  2%  KCl  +  100  ppm  Boric  acid  during  dry  spell  as  mid  season management practice  in  black  gram  during Rabi season  is  recommended  to  increase the  yield  over  KCl  spray  alone .

## Nitrogen substitution by organic sources for pulses

50 per cent nitrogen can be substituted through organic source (850 kg of vermicompost per hectare). Lime application is recommended for pulses with soil pH less than 6.0.

## SOWING THE SEEDS

Dibble the seeds adopting the following spacing.

- i) Pre emergence application of Pendimethalin 0.75 kg/ha (2.5 litres/ha) on 3 DAS mixed  with 500 litres of water using Backpack/Knapsack/Rocker sprayer using flat fan deflector type of nozzle. Then irrigate the field. Following this, one hand weeding may be given on 30-35 DAS
- ii) If herbicide is not given, give two hand weedings on 20 and 35 DAS.
- iii) In  case  of  labour  problem,  apply  Pendimethalin  0.75  kg  (2.5  lit/ha)    on  3  DAS followed  by  early post emergence application of Imazethapyr @ 60 g ai/ha on 15 DAE of weeds (2 - 3 leaves stage of weeds) and quizalofop ethyl @ 50 g ai/ha on  20  DAE  of  weeds  (2 - 3 leaves of weeds) are recommended for controlling broad leaved and grassy weeds, respectively. If both the weeds are present, tank mix application  of Imazethapyr  @ 60  g  ai/ha and quizalofop ethyl @ 50 g ai/ha at  15  -  20  days  after  emergence  of  weeds    (2  -  3    leaves  stage  of  weeds)  is recommended. Apply PE Pendimethalin 30% EC + Imazethapyr 2% EC (Valor 32% EC; Readymix herbicide) @ 1,.0 kg a.i. ha -1 at 3 DAS.
- iv) Apply PE metalachlor 1.0 kg ha -1 on 3 DAS followed by one hand weeding on 40 DAS. Note: At the time of herbicide application, there should be sufficient soil moisture

## 7. WATER MANAGEMENT

Irrigate immediately after sowing, 3 rd day after sowing, bud initiation, 50 % flowering and pod development stages. Water stagnation should be avoided.

## 8. FOLIAR APPLICATION

- a) Foliar spray of NAA 40 mg/l once at pre-flowering and another at 15 days thereafter
- b) Foliar spray of DAP 20 g/l or urea 20 g/l once at flowering and another at 15 days there after
- c) Foliar spray of salicylic and 100 mg/litre once at preflowering and another at 15 days there after

## 9. HARVESTING THE CROP

- 1) Harvest the whole plants when 80% of the pods mature.
- 2) Heap for 2 - 3 days
- 3) Dry and process.

## 10. INTER-CROPPING

- a) Raise  one  row  of  long  duration  redgram  varieties  as  inter  crop  for  every  six rows  of groundnut (6:1) under rainfed  situation.
- b) Raise one row of short or medium duration redgram as inter crop for every four rows of groundnut (4:1) under rainfed as well as irrigated  condition.
- c) Multistoreyed  cropping : For  rainfed  Vertisols  of  Virudhunagar,  Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi districts recording more than 300 mm of rainfall during the crop growth  period,  multistoreyed  cropping  system  Agathi  +  Redgram  (Co  5)  + Cotton (MCU 10) + Blackgram (Co 5) is highly profitable. (Agathi in I tier with 1 x 1 m spacing - Redgram in II tier with a spacing  of 45 x 20 cm - Cotton in the III tier with a spacing of 45 x 15 cm - Blackgram in the IV tier with the spacing of 30 x 10 cm). For rainfed Vertisols receiving less than 300 mm of rainfall, Agathi + Sorghum (CO 26) + Cotton (MCU 10) + Blackgram (Co 5) system is ideal. (Agathi in I tier with a spacing  of 1 x 1  m - sorghum in II tier with a spacing  of 45 x 15 cm cotton in III tier with the spacing of 45 x  15 cm and Blackgram in IV tier with 30 x 10 cm). For both systems, apply 40 kg N and 20 kg P O /ha.2 5

## 11. REDGRAM TRANSPLANTING

- · Select only long duration redgram varieties
- · Transplant within the month of August either under rainfed condition or under irrigated condition
- · Select poly bag with a size of 6x4 inches and 200 micron thickness
- · Fill the poly bag with native soil: Sand: FYM @1:1:1 and put 3-4 holes in the bottom to avoid water stagnation
- · Soak the seeds in 0.2% Calcium chloride for one hour and dry it under shade for 7 hours to harden the seeds
- · Treat the hardened seeds with T. viride @ 4g/kg and 100 g Rhizobium and 100 g phosphobacterium. Sow the seeds @2/poly bag at 1 cm depth
- · Sow the seeds in polybags 30-45 days prior to transplanting
- · Plough the field deeply to get fine tilth followed by 2-3 harrowings at 3 weeks prior to transplanting
- · In medium to deep soils for raising long duration varieties, dig 15 sqcm pits at 5' X 3' for pure crops and 6' x 3'  for intercropping  under irrigated  condition.   In rainfed  condition  dig the pits at a spacing of 5'x3'. For short duration varieties dig 15 sq cm pits at 3' x 2' spacing.
- · Under water logging condition, form furrows before digging pits
- · Apply inorganic fertilizers @ 25:50:25 kg NPK /ha at 20-30 days after planting as urea, DAP and potash around the  seedlings
- · Apply ZnSO4 @ 25 kg/ ha as basal along with FYM or sand

- · Nip (removal of top 5 cm) the plants at 20 - 30 days after  planting  to arrest  the terminal growth
- · Foliar  Spray  of  Napthalene  aceptic  acid  (NAA)  @  0.5  ml/litre  to  control  flower dropping in red gram.

## 12. NUTRITIONAL DISORDERS

Redgram / Greengram/Blackgram/Cowpea

- Zinc:  Symptom  appears  within  a  month  of  sowing.  The  plants  are  stripped    with yellow    or  pale  green  foliage.  Veins  and  mid  ribs  of  the  leaves  are  green although tissue around them becomes yellow and bronzed.

Iron:  Reduced  concentration  of  Chlorophyll  in  leaves  -  pale  leaf  colour  may  be indistinguishable from deficiency of nitrogen or other elements.

## CROP PHYSIOLOGY

Foliar spray of TNAU Pulse Wonder @ 2 kg/acre in 200 litres of water  at flower initiation  stage decreases flower shedding, increases yield and offers moisture stress tolerance

## SEED PRODUCTION RED GRAM - VARIETAL SEED PRODUCTION

## Land requirement

- · Land should be free of volunteer plants. The previous crop should not be of the same variety or other varieties of the same crop. It can be the same variety if it is certified as per the procedures of certification agency.

## Isolation

- · For certified seed production leave a distance of 100 m all around the field from the same and other varieties of red gram.

## Pre-sowing seed treatment

- · Soak the seeds for 3 h in 100 ppm ZnSO4 (10 g / 100 lit of water) in 1/3 volume before sowing and quickly air dry in shade to their original moisture content.
- · Treat the seeds with carbendazim 75 % WP 2 g dissolved in 5 ml of water per kg of seeds and air-dried.
- · Pellet the seeds with Rhizobium culture (50 g / kg of seed) before sowing.

## Foliar application

- · Spray 2 % DAP at the time of flowering and a second spray at 15 days after the first spray.
- · Spray NAA 40 ppm at the time of flowering and a second spray at 15 days after the first spray.

## Pre-harvest sanitation spray

- · Spray (0.05 %) malathion 50 EC 3 - 5 days before harvest to minimize the carryover of bruchid infestation from field to storage.

## Harvest

- · Harvest the pods at physiological maturity stage (approximately 40 days after 50 % flowering).
- · Collect the seeds from first and second pickings for quality seeds.

## Drying

- · Dry the pods to about 15 % moisture content.
- · Dry the seeds to 10 % moisture content.

## Seed grading

- · Size grade the large seeded varieties using BSS 5 x 5 or BSS 6 x 6 wire mesh sieve.
- · Discard the discoloured and broken seeds for seed purpose.

## Pre-storage seed treatment

- · Treat the seeds with carbendazim 2 g using 5 ml of water / kg of seed (or) dry dress the  seeds  with  halogen  mixture  (CaOCl2  +  CaCO3  +  arappu  ( Albizzia  amara )  leaf powder at 5:4:1 ratio @ 3 g / kg of seed.

## Storage

- · Store the seeds with a seed moisture content of 10 - 12 % in gunny or cloth bags for short term storage (8 - 9 months).
- · Store the seeds with a seed moisture content of 8 - 9 % in polylined gunny bag for medium term storage (12 - 15 months).
- · Store the seeds with a seed moisture content less than 8% in 700 gauge polythene bag for long term storage (more than 15 months)

## RED GRAM HYBRID SEED PRODUCTION

## Land requirement

- · Select fertile land with good drainage and irrigation facilities.
- · Field should be free from volunteer plants. Hence, the previous crop should not be the same or different variety / hybrid of redgram.

## Isolation

- · For foundation seed production (parental lines seed production), leave a distance of 200 m all around the field from the same and other varieties / hybrids of redgram.
- · For hybrid seed production from the same and other varieties / hybrids of redgram, leave a distance of 100 m all around the field.

## Planting ratio

- · Sow the female and male lines at a ratio of 4:2.

## Border rows

- · Sow 2 rows of the male parent all around the field for effective pollination.

## Spacing

- · 45 x 15 cm.

## Fertilizer

- · Apply NPK @ 25:50:25 kg / ha -1 as basal application.

## Roguing

- · Pull out all male fertile plants in female rows for genetic purity maintenance.

## Pre-storage seed treatment

- · Treat the seeds with carbendazim @ 2 g using 5 ml of water / kg of seed.
- · Dry dress the seeds with halogen mixture (CaOCl2 + CaCO3 + arappu ( Albizia amara ) leaf powder mixed in 5:4:1 ratio @ 3 g / kg of seed.
- · Treat the seeds with turmeric rhizome powder (or) neem leaf powder at 1:50 ratio against bruchid infestation as an eco-friendly seed treatment.

## PERENNIAL REDGRAM

Variety

:

BSR 1

Economic uses

: Tender beans are pinkish green in colour and can be cooked as curry or added to Kurma or Sabji. When the beans mature they can be used as Dhal. Recommended  for growing in kitchen gardens, backyards, farm road sides, as border crop in sugarcane, banana and betelvine and as a shade crop in turmeric  and  as  a  bund  crop  in  paddy  double cropped wetlands.

Season

: June - July Height of the plant: 150 - 200 cm Number of branches 7 - 10

Flowering

:

Five months from date of  sowing

Pit Size

: Small pits are dug 90 cm apart and the pits are filled with a mixture of well decomposed  manure  or compost and soil.

Fertilizer application :

Urea 15 g and superphosphate 30 g / pit.

Planting methods :

Two to three seeds are dibbled per pit and watered. When they grow six inches  height  one plant may be retained in each pit.

Irrigation :

Need based

Harvesting

: If harvested when the pods are tender the beans will be  fit for  making  curry.  Each  plant  will  yield  two  to three kg of green pods at an average seed yield of 750 g  to  one  kg  per  plant.  After  the  first  harvest  the branches are pruned and allowed to grow further. In another 45 - 60 days the plants produce the second flush.  For  pure  crop,  about  3  kg  of  seeds  may  be required.

## CROP MANAGEMENT

## IV. MANAGEMENT OF FIELD OPERATIONS

## 1. FIELD PREPARATION

- i. Prepare the land to fine tilth and form beds and channels.
- ii. Amendments for soil surface crusting: To tide over the soil  surface  crusting  apply lime at the rate of 2t /ha along with FYM at 12.5 t/ha or composted coirpith at 12.5 t/ha to get an  additional yield of about 15 - 20%.

## 2. SEED TREATMENT

Treat the seeds with Carbendazim or Thiram @ 2 g/kg of seed 24 hours before sowing (or)  with    talc  formulation  of Trichoderma viride @ 4g/kg of seed (or) Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10  g/kg seed. Bio control agents are compatible with biofertilizers. First treat  the  seeds  with  Biocontrol  agents  and  then  with  Rhizobium.  Fungicides  and biocontrol agents are incompatible.

Note: Seed treatment will protect the seedlings from seed borne pathogens, root-rot and seedlings diseases.

## 3. SEED TREATMENT WITH BIOFERTILIZER

- a) Treat the seeds required for sowing 1 ha with 200g each of Rhizobial culture COG 15, Phosphobacteria and PGPR ( Pseudomonas sp.) using rice gruel, shade dry it before sowing.    (or)  Treat  one  hectare  of  seeds  with  25  g  each  of  each  of  powder formulation  of Rhizobium and  AM fungi  using  binder  (polymer),  shade  dry  before sowing.
- b) If seed treatment is not carried out, apply 2 kg each Rhizobial culture, Phosphobacteria and PGPR ( Pseudomonas sp.) with 25 kg of FYM and 25 kg of sand, mix uniformly before sowing.

## 4. FERTILIZER APPLICATION

If soil test is not done, apply fertilizers basally before sowing

- a) Apply fertilizers basally before  sowing.

## e) Foliar spraying to mitigate moisture stress

Foliar  spraying  of  2%  KCl  +  100  ppm  Boric  acid  during  dry  spell  as  mid  season management practice in black gram during Rabi season is recommended to increase  the yield  over  KCl  spray  alone .

## Economizing the use of micronutrients through seed treatment for blackgram

Seed coating with biofertilizers and micronutrients  viz., Zn, Mo &amp; Co @ 4, 1, 0.5 g/kg of seed  is recommended.

## Nitrogen substitution by organic sources for pulses

50  per  cent  nitrogen  can  be  substituted  through  organic  source  (850  kg  of vermicompost pe hectare). Lime application is recommended for pulses with soil pH less than 6.0.

## 5. SOWING OF SEEDS

- a) For irrigated crop dibble the seeds adopting 30 x 10 cm spacing
- b) For rainfed crop dibble the seeds adopting 25 cm x 10 cm spacing

## 6. WATER MANAGEMENT

Irrigate immediately after sowing, followed by life irrigation on third  day.  Irrigate  at intervals of 7 to 10 days depending upon soil and climatic conditions. Flowering and pod formation  stages are critical periods when irrigation is a must. Avoid water stagnation at all stages. Apply KCl at 0.5 per cent as foliar spray during vegetative stage if there is moisture stress.

## 7. FOLIAR APPLICATION

- a. Foliar  spray  of  NAA  40  mg/litre  once  at  pre-flowering  and  another  at  15  days thereafterto reduce flower shedding.
- b. i) For rice fallow crops foliar spray of TNAU Pulse wonder @ 5 kg/ha once at
- flowering to decreases flower shedding. ii) For irrigated and rainfed crops, foliar spray of TNAU Pulse wonder @ 5 kg/ha once at flowering
- c. Foliar spray of salicylic acid 100 mg/litre once at preflowering and another at 15 days there  after to improve translocation efficiency and seed yield.

## 8. WEED MANAGEMENT

- i) Pre  emergence  application  of  Pendimethalin  1.0    litres/ha    under    irrigated condition, PE application of   Pendimethalin 0.75 litres/ha under rainfed condition on 3  days  after  sowing  using  Backpack/  Knapsack/Rocker  sprayer  fitted  with  flat  fan nozzle using 500 litres of water for spraying one ha followed by one hand weeding at 20 DAS (or) EPOE application of quizalofop ethyl @ 50 g ai/ha -1 and imazethapyr @ 50 g ai ha -1 on 15 - 20 DAS. If herbicides are not applied give two hand weedings on 15 and 30 days after sowing.
- ii) Apply PE Pendimethalin 30% EC + Imazethapyr 2% EC (Valor 32% EC; Readymix herbicide) @ 1.0 kg a.i. ha -1 at 3 DAS.

## 9. Multi bloom technology

A  special  technology  being  practiced  in  Pattukottai  block  of  Tanjore  district  for blackgram and greengram. The soil is alluvial and rich in organic matter and nutrients. The crop is sown during early summer (Jan.-Feb.) as normal crop and fertilizer is applied as  per  the  recommendation    for  irrigated    crop.  In  addition  to  that,  top  dressing  of Nitrogen is done with an extra  dose  of 25 to 30 kg through  urea. Since pulses are

indeterminate growth habit and continue to produce new flashes, the  top dressing will be done on 40-45 days after sowing. The crops complete its first flesh of matured pods during  60-65 th day,  further  their  second  new  flesh  within  20-25  days.  Therefore  two fleshes of pods  can be harvested at a time within the duration of 100 days.

## 1. TIME OF SOWING

Third week of January -Second week of February

## 2. SOWING OF SEEDS

- a) For relay cropping  broadcast  the seeds in the standing  crop 5 to 10 days before the harvest of the paddy  crop  uniformly  under  optimum  soil  moisture conditions  so that the seeds should get embedded in the waxy mire.
- b) For combined harvesting areas, broadcast the seeds before harvesting the paddy crop with machinerie

## 3. FOLIAR APPLICATION

- a. Foliar  Spray  of  NAA  40  mg/litre  once  at  pre-flowering  and  another  at  15  days thereafter
- b. Foliar spray of pulse wonder @ 5 kg/ha once at flowering  to decreases flower shedding and improve yield.
- c. Foliar spary of salicylic acid 100 mg/litre once at prefloweing in another and 15 days  there  after to improve translocation efficiency and seed yield.

## 4. HARVESTING

- i) Picking the matured pods, drying and processing
- ii) Uprooting or cutting the whole plants, heaping, drying and  processing

## BLACKGRAM - VARIETAL SEED PRODUCTION

## Land requirement

- · Land should be free of volunteer plants. The previous crop should not be of the same variety or other varieties of the same crop. It can be the same variety if it is certified as per the procedures of certification agency.

## Isolation

- · For certified / quality seed production, leave a distance of 5 m all around the field from the same and other varieties of the crop.

## Pre-sowing seed treatment

- · Remove all discoloured seeds and use only normal coloured seeds for seed purpose.
- · If  the presence of hard seed percentage exceeds more than 10 %, scarify the seeds

- with commercial H2SO4 for 2 min.
- · Harden blackgram seeds for garden and dry land ecosystem with 100 ppm ZnSO4 for 3 h in 1/3 volume of solution and dry seeds under shade to the original seed moisture content (8 - 9 %)

## Fertilizer

- · NPK @ 25 : 50 : 25 kg + 5 kg of TNAU micro nutrient mixture / ha.

## Foliar application

- · Spray 2 % DAP at the time of first appearance of flowers and second spray 15 days after first spray for enhanced seed set.
- · Spray  NAA 40 ppm at first flowering and at  fortnight  interval  to  reduce  the  flower drop.
- · Spray 0.1 % brassinoloid on 35 th and 45 th day after sowing.

## Pre-harvest sanitation spray

- · Spray Malathion 50 EC at 0.05 % three to five days before harvest to minimize the bruchid infestation in storage.

## Harvest

- · Harvest  the  pods  30  days  after  50  per  cent  flowering.  At  this  stage,  the  colour  of majority of the pods (80 %) will be black. The pod moisture content will be around 17 - 18 %.
- · Harvest the pods as pickings, if the flowering period is longer.
- · Dry the pods to 13 to 15 per cent moisture content.

## Threshing

- · Thresh the pods either with pliable bamboo stick or pulse thresher.

## Drying

- · Dry the seeds to 8 - 9 per cent moisture content.

## Seed grading

- · Grade the seeds using BSS 7 x 7 wire mesh sieve
- · Discard the discoloured and broken seeds for seed purpose.
- · Avoid bruchid infected seeds for sowing.

## Pre-storage seed treatment

- · Treat the seeds with carbendazim @ 2 g / kg of seed.
- · Treat the seeds with halogen mixture (CaOCl2 + CaCO3 + arappu ( Albizzia amara ) leaf powder mixed in the ratio of 5:4:1 3 g / kg of seed as eco-friendly treatment.

## Storage

- · Store the seeds with a seed moisture content of 10 - 12 % in gunny or cloth bags for short term storage (8 - 9 months).
- · Store the seeds with a seed moisture content of 8 - 9 % in polylined gunny bag for medium term storage (12 - 15 months).
- · Store the seeds with a seed moisture content less than 8 % in 700 gauge polythene bag for long term storage (more than15 months).

## II. MANAGEMENT OF FIELD OPERATIONS

## 1. FIELD PREPARATION

- i. Prepare the land to get fine tilth and form beds and channels.
- ii Amendments for soil surface crusting:  To  tide  over  the  soil  surface  crusting  apply lime at the rate of 2 t/ha along with FYM at 12.5 t/ha or composted coir pith at 12.5 t/ha to get an additional yield of about 15 - 20%.

## 2. SEED TREATMENT

Treat the seeds with Carbendazim or Thiram @ 2 g/kg of seed 24 hours before  sowing (or)    with  talc  formulation  of Trichoderma  viride @  4g/kg  of  seed  (or) Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10  g/kg  seed.  Bio  control  agents  are  compatible  with  biofertilizers.  First treat the seeds with Biocontrol agents and then with Rhizobium. Fungicides and biocontrol agents are incompatible.

## 3. SEED TREATMENT WITH BIOFERTILIZER

- a) Treat the seeds required for sowing 1 ha with 200g each of Rhizobial culture COG 15, Phosphobacteria  and  PGPR  ( Pseudomonas sp.)  using  rice  gruel,  shade  dry  it  before sowing.  (or) Treat one hectare of seeds with 25 g each of each of powder formulation of Rhizobium and AM fungi using binder (polymer), shade dry before sowing.
- b) If seed treatment is not carried out, apply 2 kg each Rhizobial culture, Phosphobacteria and PGPR ( Pseudomonas sp.) with 25 kg of FYM and 25 kg of sand, mix uniformly before sowing.

## 4. FERTILIZER APPLICATION

If soil test is not done  , Apply fertilizers basally before sowing. Rainfed : 12.5 kg N + 25 kg P2O5 + 12.5 kg K2O +20 kg S*/ha Irrigated : 25 kg N + 50 kg P2O5 + 25 kg K2O + 40 kg S*/ha

*Note : Applied in the form of gypsum if Single Super Phospate is not applied as a source of phosphorus

condition

- d) Soil application of TNAU micronutrient mixture @ 5 kg/ha as Enriched FYM (Prepare enriched FYM at 1:10 ratio of MN mixture &amp; FYM ; mix at friable moisture &amp;incubate for one month in shade).
- 50 kg FeSO4 as EFYM or 10 by Fe EDTA ha -1 for the deficient soils.

## Multi-blooming technology for irrigated green gram in new delta region of Thanjavur

For higher yield and income, apply 25:50:25:20 kg NPKS/ha.+25  kg N/ha. in 3 equal splits on 30, 45 and 60 days after sowing + 2% DAP spray on 45 and 60 days after sowing.

Foliar  spraying  of  0.5%  ZnSO4  thrice,  1%  FeSO4  +  0.1%  citric  acid  thrice  can  be followed when plants shows deficiency symptoms at 7-10 days intervals.

## e) Foliar spray of 1% urea for yield improvement in green  gram

For yield improvement through increasing the  physiological,  biochemical  attributes, foliar spray of urea 1% on 30 and 45 days after sowing is recommended. For  rice  fallow pulses    in  Delta  area,  the  present  recommendation  of  foliar  spray  of  2%  DAP  may  be continued.

## Economizing the use of micronutrients through seed treatment for greengram

Seed coating with biofertilizers and micronutrients viz., Zn, Mo &amp; Co @ 4,1,0.5 g/kg of seed is recommended.

## 5. SOWING

Dibble the seeds adopting a spacing of 30 x 10 cm. For bund crop dibble the seeds at 30 cm spacing.

## 6. WATER MANAGEMENT

Irrigate immediately after sowing, followed  by life irrigation  on third day. Irrigate at interval  of 7 to 10 days depending upon soil and climatic conditions. Flowering and pod  formation  stages  are    critical  periods  when  irrigation  is  a  must.  Avoid    water stagnation  at  all  stages.    Apply  KCl  at  2.0  per    cent  as  foliar  spray  during  vegetative stage if there is moisture  stress.

## 7. FOLIAR APPLICATION

- a. Foliar  spray  of  NAA  40  mg/litre  and  Salicylic  acid  100  mg/litre  once  at  preflowering and another at 15 days thereafter to reduce flower shedding.
- b. i)  For  rice  fallow  crops,  foliar  spray  of  TNAU  Pulse  wonder  @  5  kg/ha  once  at flowering  or  DAP  20  g/litre  once  at  flowering  and  another  at  15  days thereafter
- ii) For irrigated and rainfed crops foliar spray of TNAU Pulse wonder @ 5 kg/ha once at flowering or DAP 20 g/litre or urea 20 g/litre once at flowering and another at 15 days thereafter.
- c. Foliar spray of salicylic acid 100 mg/litre at preflowering and another at 15 days therafter to improve translocation efficiency and seed yield.

## 8. WEED MANAGEMENT

- i) Pre emergence application of Pendimethalin @ 1.0 litres / ha  under  irrigated condition  or  PE  application  of  Pendimethalin  0.75  litres  per  hectare  under rainfed  condition  on  3  days  after  sowing  using  Backpack/  Knapsack/Rocker sprayer fitted with flat fan nozzle using 500 litres of water for spraying one ha. After  this,  one  hand  weeding  on  30 th days  after  sowing  gives  weed  free environment throughout the crop period  (or)  EPOE  application  of  quizalofop ethyl @ 50 g ai/ha -1 and imazethapyr @ 50 g ai ha -1 on 15 - 20 DAS.
- ii) If  herbicide  is  not  applied  give  two  hand  weedings  on  15  and  30  days  after sowing.
- iii) Apply PE Pendimethalin 30% EC + Imazethapyr 2% EC (Valor 32% EC; Readymix herbicide) @ 1.0 kg a.i. ha -1 at 3 DAS.
- iv) For the irrigated blackgram PE isoproturon @ 0.5 kg ha -1 followed  by one hand weeding  on 30 DAS.

## 9. MULTI BLOOM TECHNOLOGY

A special technology being practiced in Pattukottai block of Tanjore district for blackgram and greengram. The soil is alluvial and rich in organic matter and nutrients. The crop is sown during early summer (Jan.-Feb.) as normal crop and fertilizer is applied as  per    the  recommendation    for  irrigated  crop.  In  addition  to  that,  top  dressing  of Nitrogen  is  done  with  an  extra  dose  of  25  to  30  kg  through  urea.  Since  pulses  are indeterminate in growth habit and continue to produced new flushes, the top dressing will be done on 40-45 days after sowing. The crop complete its first flushes of matured pods during 60-65 th day and put further second new flush within 20-25 days. Therefore two flushes of pods  can be harvested at a time within the duration of 100 days.

## 1. TIME OF SOWING

Third week of January -Second week of February

## 2. SOWING OF SEEDS

- a) For relay cropping  broadcast  the seeds in the standing  crop 5 to 10 days before the harvest of the paddy  crop  uniformly  under  optimum  soil  moisture conditions  so that the seeds should get embedded in the waxy mire.
- b) For combined harvesting areas, broadcast the seeds before harvesting the paddy crop with machineries

## 3. FOLIAR APPLICATION

- a. Foliar spray of NAA 40 mg/litre once at pre-flowering and another at 15 days thereafter
- b. Foliar spray of TNAU pulse wonder @ 5 kg/ha once at flowering  or  DAP  20 g/lt once  at  flowering and another at 15 days  thereafter
- c. Foliar spray of salicylic acid100 mg/litre once at preflowering and anothere at 15 days there after.

## 4. HARVESTING

- i) Picking the matured pods, drying and processing
- ii) Uprooting or cutting the whole plants, heaping ,drying and  processing

## SEED PRODUCTION GREEN GRAM - VARIETAL SEED PRODUCTION

## Land requirement

- · Land should be free from volunteer plants. The previous crop should not be of the same variety or other varieties of the same crop. It can be of the same variety if it is certified as per the procedures of certification agency.

## Isolation

- · For certified / quality seed production leave a distance of 5 m all around the field from the same and other varieties of the crop.

## Pre-sowing seed treatment

- · Remove all discoloured seeds and use only normal coloured seeds (olive green) for seed purpose.
- · Avoid bruchid infested seeds for sowing.
- · If the presence of hard seed percentage exceeds more than 10 %, scarify the seeds with commercial H2SO4 for 2 min.
- · Harden  the  greengram  seeds  for  garden  and  dry  land  ecosystem  with  100  ppm MnSO4  for  3  h  at  the  ratio  of  1:0.3  ratio  and  dry  back  to  original  seed  moisture content (8 - 9 %) under shade.

## Fertilizer

- · NPK @ 25 : 50 : 25 kg + 5 kg TNAU micro nutrient mixture / ha.

## Foliar application

- · Spray 2 % DAP at the time of first appearance of flowers and second spray 15 days after first spray for enhanced seed set.
- · Spray NAA 40 ppm at first flowering and at fortnight interval to reduce the flower drop.
- · Spray 0.1 % brassinoloid on 35 th and 45 th day after sowing.

## Pre-harvest sanitation spray

- · Spray (0.05 %) Malathion 50 EC three to five days before harvest to minimize the bruchid infestation in storage.

## Harvest

- · Harvest the pods at 30 days after 50 % flowering when majority of the pods (80 %) are brown in colour.
- · Harvest the pods as pickings, if the flowering period is longer.

- · Dry the pods to 13 to 15 % moisture content.

## Threshing

- · Thresh the pods either with pliable bamboo stick or pulse thresher.

## ying

- · Dry the seeds to 8 - 9 % moisture content.

## Seed grading

- · Grade the seeds using BSS 7 x 7 wire mesh sieve.
- · Discard the discoloured and broken seeds for sowing or storage.

## Pre-storage seed treatment

- · Treat the seeds with carbendazim 2 g / kg of seed.
- · Treat  the  seeds  with  halogen  mixture  (CaOCl2  +  CaCO3  +  arappu  ( Albizzia  amara ) leaf powder mixed in the ratio of 5:4:1 @ 3 g / kg of seed as eco-friendly treatment.

## Storage

- · Store the seeds with a seed moisture content of 10 - 12 % in gunny or cloth bags for short term storage (8 - 9 months).
- · Store the seeds with a seed moisture content of 8 - 9 % in polylined gunny bag for medium term storage (12 - 15 months).
- · Store the seeds with a seed moisture content less than 8 % in 700 gauge polythene bag for long term storage (more than15 months).

## (iii) COWPEA ( Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.aggreg.)

## CLIMATE REQUIREMENT

|   T\_Max o C |   T\_Min C  o | Optimum  C  o   | Rainfall mm   |   Altitude m MSL |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|

Cowpea is  called  the  "hungry  -  season  crop"  because  it  is  the  first  crop  to  be  harvested before the cereal crops. Cowpea is tolerant of shading and can be combined with tall cereal plants such as sorghum and maize. It is sensitive to waterlogging, though less than other legumes.  High  moisture  may  hinder  cowpea  crops  in  the  sub  -  humid  tropics  due  to  the many diseases. Frost can damage the plant during flowering period.

## III. SEED RATE

Seed rate (pure crop) : 25 kg/ha

## CROP MANAGEMENT

## IV. MANAGEMENT OF FIELD OPERATIONS

## 1. FIELD PREPARATION

Prepare the land to fine tilth and form beds and channels.

## 2. SEED TREATMENT

Treat the seeds with Carbendazim or Thiram 2 g/kg of seed 24 hours before sowing (or) with talc formulation of Trichoderma viride @ 4g/kg of seed (or) Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 g/kg seed.

- · Biocontrol agents are compatible with biofertilizers.
- · First treat the seeds with biocontrol agents and then with Rhizobium.
- · Fungicides and biocontrol agents are incompatible.

## 3. SEED TREATMENT WITH BIOFERTILIZER

- a) Fungicide-treated  seeds,  should  be  again  treated  with  a  bacterial  culture.  There should  be  an  interval  of  atleast  24  hours  between  fungicidal  and  biofertilizer treatments.
- b) The  improved  rhizobial  strain  COC  10  is  more  effective  in    increasing    the    yield. Treat  the seeds  with one packet (200 g/ha) of Rhizobial  culture (COC 10)   and one packet (200 g/ha)   of Phosphobacteria developed at TNAU using rice kanji as binder. If the seed treatment is not carried out apply 10 packets (2 kg/ha) of Phosphobacteria    with    25    kg  of  FYM    and  25  kg  of  soil  before  sowing.  Dry  the biofertilizer treated seeds in shade for 15 minutes before sowing.

## 4. FERTILIZER APPLICATION

- a)
- Apply fertilizers basally before  sowing. Rainfed : 12.5 kg N + 25 kg P2O5 + 12.5 kg K2O +10 kg S*/ha Irrigated : 25 kg N + 50 kg P2O5 + 25 kg K2O + 20 kg S*/ha *Note : Applied in the form of gypsum if Single Super Phosphate is not applied as a source of phosphorus
- b) Soil application of 25 kg ZnSO4/ha along with 50 kg FYM or sand under irrigated condition
- c) Soil application of 10 kg borax, 0.25 kg Ammonium molybdate can be followed if the soil is deficient.

## 5. SOWING

Dibble the seeds adopting the following  spacing.

| Varieties   | Spacing       |
|-------------|---------------|
| VBN 3       | 30 cm X 15 cm |
| CO(CP) 7    | 45 cm x 15 cm |

## 6. WATER MANAGEMENT

Irrigate immediately  after sowing followed  by life irrigation  on third day. Irrigate at interval of  7 to 10 days depending upon soil and climatic conditions. Flowering and pod formation stages are  critical periods when irrigation is a must. Avoid  water stagnation  at all stages.  Apply KCl at 2.0 per  cent as foliar spray during vegetative stage if there is moisture  stress.

## 7. FOLIAR APPLICATION

- a. Foliar spray of DAP 20 g/litre or urea 20 g/litre once at flowering and another at 15 days thereafter to enhance flower number and pod setting
- b. Foliar spray of NAA 40 mg/litre once at flowering and another at 15 days thereafter to reduce flower drop
- c. Foliar spray of salicylic acid 100 mg/litre once at flowering and another at 15 days ther after to improve seed yield.

## 8. WEED MANAGEMENT

- i) Pre emergence application of Pendimethalin @ 0.75 litre / ha on 3 days after sowing  using  Backpack/  Knapsack/Rocker  sprayer  fitted  with  flat  fan  nozzle using 500 lit of water for spraying one hectare followed by one hand weeding on 30 days  after  sowing  gives  weed free environment throughout the crop period.
- ii) If  herbicide  is  not  applied,  give  two  hand  weeding  on  15  and  30  days  after sowing.

Dibble the seeds by adopting a spacing of 30 cm x 10 cm.

## 6. WEED MANAGEMENT

- i) Pre emergence application of Pendimethalin @ 0.75 litres / ha on 3 rd day after sowing using Backpack/ Knapsack/Rocker sprayer fitted with flat fan nozzle using 500 litres of water for spraying one ha followed by one hand weeding on 25 - 30 days after sowing.
- ii) If herbicide is not applied give two hand weedings on 15 th and 30 th day after sowing.

## 7. INTERCROPPING IN BENGALGRAM

Bengalgram  in  paired  row  planting  with  one  or  two  rows  of  Coriander  as  intercrop would give the highest return. Wheat can also be intercropped in deep black  cotton soil  in  Coimbatore,  Erode, Salem, Namakkal and Dharmapuri districts.

## BENGAL GRAM - SEED PRODUCTION

## Land requirements

- · Land should be free of volunteer plants. The previous crop should not be of the same variety or other varieties of the same crop. It can be the same variety if it is certified as per the procedures of certification agency.

## Isolation

- · For certified / quality seed production leave a distance of 5 m all around the field from the same and other varieties of bengal gram.

## Pre-sowing treatment

- · Soak the seeds in 1 % KH2PO4 for 3 h in 1/3 rd volume of solution and shade dry the seeds to bring back to original seed moisture content.
- · Avoid bruchid infested seed for seed purpose.

## Harvesting

- · Harvest the crop at once when 70 - 80 % of pods are creamy yellow in colour.

## Seed grading

- · Grade the seeds using 13 / 64' or 18 / 64" sieves depending on the variety.
- · Dry the seeds to 8 - 10 % moisture content

## Pre-storage seed treatment

- · Treat the seeds with carbendazim @ 2 g / kg of seed.
- · Treat  seeds  with  halogen  mixture  (CaOCl2  +  CaCO3  +  arappu  ( Albizzia  amara )  leaf powder mixed in a ratio of 5:4:1@ 3 g / kg of seed as eco-friendly treatment.

## Storage

- · Store the seeds with a seed moisture content of 9 - 10 % in gunny or cloth bags for short term storage (8 - 9 months).
- · Store the seeds with a seed moisture content of 8 - 9 % in polylined gunny bag for medium term storage (12 - 15 months).
- · Store the seeds with a seed moisture content less than 8 % in 700 gauge polythene bag for long term storage (more than 15 months).

## CROP MANAGEMENT

## II. MANAGEMENT OF FIELD OPERATIONS

## 1. FIELD PREPARATION

Prepare the land to fine tilth. Form beds and channels for bushy types.

## 2. SEED TREATMENT WITH FUNGICIDES

Treat the seeds with Carbendezim (or) Thiram @ 2g/kg of seed 24hrs before sowing (or)  with  talc  formulation  of Trichoderma  viride @ 4 g/kg seed (or) Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 g/kg seed. Biocontrol agents are compatible with biofertilizers. First treat the seeds with biocontrol  agents  and  then with Rhizobium. Fungicides and biocontrol agents are incompatible.

## 3. SEED TREATMENT WITH BACTERIAL CULTURE

Fungicide treated seeds should be again treated with bacterial culture. There should be  an  interval of atleast 24  hours  between  fungicidal  and  bacterial  culture treatments.  Three  packets  of  bacterial  culture  are  sufficient  for  treating    seeds required  for one ha. The bacterial  culture slurry may  be prepared with rice kanji. Dry the inoculated seeds in shade for 15 minutes before sowing.

## 4. FERTILIZER APPLICATION

- (a)  Apply fertilizers basally before  sowing.

Rainfed : 12.5 kg N + 25 kg P2O5 + 12.5 kg K2O +10 kg S*/ha Irrigated : 25 kg N + 50 kg P2O5 + 25 kg K2O + 20 kg S*/ha

*Note : Applied in the form of gypsum if Single Super Phospate is not applied as a sourceof phosphorus

- (b)  Soil  application  of  25  kg  ZnSO /ha  10  kg  borax,  5  kg  CuSO4  under  irrigated 4 condition if  the soil is deficient in respective nutrients.

## 5. SOWING

Dibble the seeds adopting the following spacing. Varieties CO (Gb) 1   :   45 cm X 30 cm

## 6. WEED MANAGEMENT

Pre emergence application of Pendimethalin @ 0.75 litres/ha on 3 days after sowing using Backpack/ Knapsack/Rocker sprayer fitted with flat fan nozzle using 500 litres of water for spraying one ha. After this, one hand weeding on 40-45 days after sowing gives weed free environment throughout the crop period.

If herbicide is applied give two hand weedings on 25 and 45days after sowing.

## 7. WATER MANAGEMENT

Irrigate  immediately  after  sowing,  followed  by  life  irrigation  on  third  day.  Irrigate atinterval of 7 to 10 days depending upon soil and climatic conditions. Flowering and pod  formation  stages  are  critical  periods  when  irrigation  is  a  must.  Avoid  water stagnation at all stages. Apply KCl at the rate of 0.5 per cent as foliar spray during vegetative stage if there is moisture stress.

## 8. PRUNING TECHNIQUE

A spacing of about 10 feet between lines and four feet between plants are adopted. Pits are  dug and two to three seeds are sown in the middle of the pit. One healthy seedling is allowed to grow and the rest removed. The vine is propped with a stick. When the vine  reaches  the  pandal,  the terminal bud is nipped. Allow the branches to trail over the pandal. Each branch  may be pruned  at  three feet length so that the pandal is covered with vines.  Branches  arising  on the main  vine  below the pandal are removed. When flowering starts, prune the tip of the branches bearing inflorescence having three nodes from the productive axil. Continue this procedure throughout  the  reproductive phase.

## 9. HARVESTING

Pick the pods when they are completely dry. Thresh the pods and clean the beans. Pick the tender pods once in a week for vegetable purpose.

## Isolation

- · For certified  seed  production leave a distance of 5 m all around the field from the same and other varieties of the crop.

## Pre-harvest sanitation spray

- · Spray 0.07 % malathion before harvesting the pods to avoid bruchid infestation.

## Harvest

- · Harvest the pods when they turn straw yellow in colour.
- · Discard the terminal pods for seed purpose as they contain immature seeds.
- · Dry the pods to 15 - 18 % moisture content.

## Drying

- · Dry the seeds to 8 - 10 % moisture content.

## Seed grading

- · Grade the seeds using 18 / 64' round perforated sieves.
- · Remove the broken and immature seeds.
- · Dry the seeds to 7 to 8 per cent moisture content.

## Pre-storage seed treatment

- · Treat  the  seeds  with  carbendazim  at  2  g  /  kg  of  seed  along  with  carbaryl  at  200 mg / kg of seed.
- · Treat  seeds  with  halogen  mixture  (CaOCl2  +  CaCO3  +  arappu  ( Albizzia  amara )  leaf powder mixed in the ratio of 5:4:1 @ 3 g / kg as eco-friendly treatment.

## Storage

- · Store the seeds with a seed moisture content of 9 - 10% in gunny or cloth bags for short term storage (8-9 months).

## CROP MANAGEMENT II. MANAGEMENT OF FIELD OPERATIONS

## 1. FIELD PREPARATION

Prepare the land to fine tilth.

## 2. SEED TREATMENT WITH FUNGICIDES

Treat the seeds with Carbendezim (or) Thiram @ 2g/kg of seed 24hrs before sowing (or) with talc formulation of Trichoderma viride @ 4 g/kg seed (or) Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 g/kg seed.

- · Biocontrol agents are compatible with biofertilizers.
- · First treat the seeds with biocontrol agents and then with Rhizobium.
- · Fungicides and biocontrol agents are incompatible

## 3. SEED TREATMENT WITH BACTERIAL CULTURE

Fungicide treated seeds should be again treated with bacterial culture. There should be an  interval  of  atleast  24  hours  between  fungicidal  and  bacterial  culture  treatments. Three packets of bacterial culture are sufficient for treating  seeds required  for one hectare.    The  bacterial    culture  may    be  prepared  with  rice  kanji.  Dry  the  inoculated seeds in shade for 15 minutes, before sowing.

## 4. FERTILIZER APPLICATION

Apply 20 kg N and 80 kg P2O5 and 40 kg K2O per ha 40 kg of S as gypsum (220 kg/ha)/ ha as basal dressing.  Soil application of 25 kg ZnSO4/ha,10 kg borax, 25 kg FeSO4 + FYM under irrigated condition if the soil is deficient in respective nutrients.

## 5. FOLIAR APPLICATION

- i. Foliar spray of NAA 40 mg/litre and Salicylic acid 100 mg/litre once at pre-flowering and another at 15 days thereafter to reduce flower drop and enhance seed set.
- ii. Foliar spray of DAP 20 g/litre or urea 20 g/litre once at flowering and another at 15 days thereafter to enhance flower number and pod set

## 6. SOWING

Dibble the seeds, adopting the following spacing. Strain Sole crop Mixed crop

## SOYABEAN - SEED PRODUCTION VARIETAL SEED PRODUCTION

## Land requirement

- · Land should be free of volunteer plants. The previous crop should not be of the same variety  or  other  varieties  of  the  same  crop.  It  can  be  of  the  same  variety  if  it  is certified as per the procedures of certification agency.

## Isolation

- · For  certified  /  quality  seed  production  leave  a  distance  of  3  m  all  around  the  field from the same and other varieties of the crop.

## Harvest

- · Harvest the pods as they turn yellow in colour.

## Threshing

- · Thresh the pods either manually or mechanically using pliable bamboo sticks.

## Seed grading

- · Grade the seeds using 14 / 64' or 12 / 64' sieves based on the varieties.

## Drying

- · Dry the seeds to 7- 8 % moisture content.

## Pre-storage seed treatment

- · Treat with carbendazim @ 2 g / kg of seed along with carbaryl @ 200 mg / kg of seed.
- · Treat  seeds  with  halogen  mixture  (CaOCl2  +  CaCO3  +  arappu  ( Albizzia  amara )  leaf powder mixed in the ratio of 5:4:1 @ 3 g / kg as eco-friendly treatment.

## Storage

- · Store the seeds with a seed moisture content of 10 - 12 % in gunny or cloth bags for short term storage (8 - 9 months).
- · Store the seeds with a seed moisture content of 8 - 10 % in polylined gunny bag for medium term storage (12 - 15 months).
- · Store the seeds with a seed moisture content less than 7 % in 700 gauge polythene bag for long term storage (more than15 months).

Tropical  and  subtropical  warm  and  moist  climate.  It  is  widely  cultivated  in  the  humid tropics.tolerates salinity and waterlogging. This crop can grow in light shade under trees to serve as a nitrogen - fixing cover crop.

## CROP IMPROVEMENT

Sword  bean  SBS  1  is  an  introduction  and  is  one  of  the  vegetables  with  photoinsensitivity. It matures in 110 - 120 days. It can be grown throughout the year and gives good  response  to  irrigation.  Tender  pods  are  ready  for  harvest  from  75  days  after sowing.  As a pure  crop  it gives  an average  grain yield of 1356 kg/ha and green pod yield of 7500 kg/ha. This can also be grown as border crop, intercrop and a shade crop.

•

Fertilizers (kg/ha) :  25 N 50 P2O5

• Spacing : 45 x 30 cm (irrigated), 30x20 cm rainfed

## INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT FOR PULSE PESTS

## 1. Stem fly

- · It attacks blackgram, greengram and cowpea.
- · Adult fly is blackish and lay eggs on the young leaves
- · Affected plants get dried
- · Immature stage will be inside the stem
- · Economic threshold level is 10% damage

## 2. Aphids

- · Attacks blackgram, greengram, lab lab, cowpea and redgram.
- · Congregated on the growing shoots, leaves, flowers and  pods.
- · Affected plants will be weak and stunted
- · Because of honeydew ant movements will be there

## 3. Whiteflies

- · Attacks blackgram, greengram, cowpea and soyabean
- · Act as vector for yellow mosaic virus disease

## 4. Bugs

- · Desap the flowers and  pods
- · Affected pods show shriveled  grains

## 5. Pod borers

- · Gram  pod  borer,  spotted  pod  borer,  blue  butterflies,  pod  fly  and  blister beetles are the major borers
- · Blister beetles feed on flower buds, flowers and young pods
- · Spotted pod borers web the flowers and young pods
- · Gram pod borer, plume moth and blue butterflies bore into the  pods
- · Pod fly feed on the seeds of  redgram.

## IPM

-  Take  up  the  sowing  of  blackgram  from  September  to  November  with increased seed rate (25 kg/ha) in stem fly endemic  areas.
-  Remove alternate hosts
-  Use of pheromone traps @ 12/ha for Gram pod borer
-  Spray insecticides like methyl demeton or dimethoate or monocrotophos @ 500ml/ha to reduce the sucking insects
-  Spray Neem seed kernel extract (25 kg/ha) against pod borers
-  Avoid insecticidal spray when parasitoids and predators activity is high.

## 6. Storage pests

-  Dry the seeds adequately to reduce moisture level to 10  %.
-  Use pitfall traps or two in one model trap to assess the time of emergence of field carried  over  pulse  beetle  in  storage  and  accordingly  sun-dry  the produce.
-  Seed: Mix any one of the following for every 100 kg : Activated kaolin 1 kg Malathion 5 D 1 kg TNAU Neem oil 60 EC (C) 1lit. Pungam oil

1lit.

Monocrotophos  36 SL    400 ml

## CROP MANAGEMENT

## I. Rainfed

## 1. FIELD PREPARATION

- i) Plough  with  tractor  using  a disc followed  by harrow,  once  or twice  with iron  plough  or   3 - 4 times with country plough till all the clods are broken and a fine tilth is obtained.
- ii) Chiselling for soils with hard pan: Chisel the soils having  hard  pan  formation at shallow depth with chisel plough first at 0.5 m interval in one direction and then in the direction perpendicular to the previous one, once in three years. Apply 12.5 t/ha  of  FYM  or  composted coir pith besides chiselling.
- iii) Amendments  for  soil  surface  crusting:  a)  To  tide  over  the  surface  crusting,

apply lime @ 2  t/ha along  with FYM or composted  coir pith @ 12.5 t/ha. b) Coir pith at 12.5 t/ha  converted  to compost by inoculating with Pleurotus and applied serves as a good source of nutrients.

## 2. APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS

Apply NPK fertilizers as per soil test recommendation. If soil test is not done, follow the blanket recommendation.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

For rainfed groundnut -castor intercropping system, apply the recommended dose of 10:10: 45 kg NPK ha -1 to the main crop of groundnut and for castor apply the recommended dose of 40 kg N

Soil test crop response based integrated plant nutrition system (STCRIPNS) recommendation may be adopted for prescribing fertilizer doses for specified yield targets. (ready reckoners are furnished )

shade).    Broadcast    evenly  on    the  soil  surface  immediately  after  sowing.  Do  not incorporate micronutrient mixture in to the soil.

## 5. NUTRITIONAL DISORDER

Zinc deficiency : Apply 25 kg ZnSO4/ha as basal.

- If soil analysis shows less than 1.2 ppm of zinc, soil application of 25 kg ZnSO4 is recommended. Reduce ZnSO4 application from 25.0 kg ha -1 to 12.5 kg ha -1 if FYM is applied @ 12.5 t ha -1. For the standing crop, less than 39.4 ppm of zinc in leaves, foliar spray of 0.5% ZnSo4 is recommended.

Iron deficiency : Foliar of spray 1% FeSO4 + 0.1% citric acid thrice on 30, 40 and 50 days after sowing.

Boron deficiency : Application of Borax 10 kg

Sulphur deficiency: Gypsum 400 kg/ha as soil application at 45 th day after sowing.

## 6. SEED RATE

Use 120 kg/ha of kernels, 175 kg/ha of kernels for bold seeded varieties.

## 7. SPACING

Adopt  a  spacing  of  30  cm  between  rows  and  10  cm  between  plants.  Wherever groundnut ring mosaic (bud necrosis) is prevalent, adopt a spacing of 15cm x 15 cm.

## 8. SEED TREATMENT

- i) Treat the seeds with talc formulation of Trichoderma viride @ 4 g/kg seed or Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 g/kg seed.
- Biocontrol  agents are compatible  with biofertilizers. Treat the seeds with biocontrol agents first and then with Rhizobium . Fungicides and biocontrol agents are incompatible.
- ii) Treat the seeds with Trichoderma @ 4g/kg. This can be done just before sowing. It  is compatible with biofertilizers. SUCH SEEDS SHOULD NOT BE TREATED WITH FUNGICIDES (or)
- iii) Treat  the  seeds  with  Thiram  or  Mancozeb  @  4  g/kg  of  seed  or  Carboxin  or Carbendazim at 2 g/kg of seed.
- iv) Treat one hectare of seeds with 125 ml of Rhizobium (TNAU 14) and 125 ml of Phosphobacteria,  shade dry it for 30 minutes before sowing

## 9. SOWING

- · Use Kovai seed drill/gorru to sow the seeds in lines.
- · Put one seed in each hole. Protect the seeds from crows and squirrels.

## 10. INTERCROPPING

- i) Raise one row of cowpea for every five rows of groundnut wherever  red hairy caterpillar  is endemic.
- ii) Raise intercrops like redgram, blackgram, sunflower, gingelly or other pulses.
- iii) Cumbu can be raised as  intercrop.
- iv) Groundnut + Gingelly or Groundnut + Blackgram in the ratio of 4:1 or Groundnut + Cowpea at 6:1 ratio and Groundnut + Sunflower at 6:2 ratio may be raised.

## 11. WEED MANAGEMENT

- i) Pre-emergence : Pendimethalin @ 1.0 litre/ha applied through flat fan nozzle with 500 l of water/ha. After 35 - 40 days one hand weeding may be given.
- ii) If  no  herbicide is applied two hand weeding may be given on 20 th and 40 th day after sowing.

## 12. EARTHING UP

Accomplish earthing up during second hand weeding/late hand weeding  (in herbicide application).

NOTE: i) Earthing up provides medium for the peg development ii) Use the improved hoe  with  long  handle  which  can  be  worked  more  efficiently  in  a  standing position. iii) Do not disturb the soil after 45 th day of sowing as it will affect pod formation adversely.

## 13. APPLICATION OF CALCIUM SULPHATE (GYPSUM)

- i) Apply  gypsum  @  400  kg/ha  by  the  side  of  the  plants  on  40th  to  70th  day depending upon soil moisture.
- ii) Apply gypsum, hoe and incorporate it in the soil and then earth  up.
- iii) Avoid gypsum in calciferous  soils.
- iv) Gypsum is effective in soils deficient in calcium and sulphur.

NOTE: Application of gypsum encourages pod formation and better filling up of the pods.

Application of gypsum at the rate of 50 % basal both  in  rainfed  and  irrigated condition reduces Khadhasty malady and pod scab nematode

## Combined nutrient spray

Pod filling is a major problem especially in the bold seed varieties. To improve pod filling spraying of nutrient solution is to be given. This can be prepared by soaking DAP 2.5 kg, Ammonium sulphate 1 kg and borax 0.5 kg in 37 lit of water overnight. The next day morning it can be filtered and about 32 litre of mixture can be obtained  and it may be diluted  with  468 lit of water  so as to made  up to 500 litre to spray for one ha. Planofix at the rate of 350 ml. can also be mixed while spraying. This  can be sprayed on 25 th and 35 th day after sowing.

## 14. HARVESTING

- i) Observe the crop, considering its average duration. Drying and falling of older leaves and yellowing of the top leaves indicate maturity.
- ii) Pull out a few plants at random and shell the pods. If the inner shell is brownish black and not white, then the crop has  matured.
- iii) Irrigate prior to harvest, if the soil is dry, as this will facilitate easy harvesting. If there is enough moisture in the soil, there is no need for irrigation for harvesting.
- iv) If water is not available for irrigating the field prior to harvest, work a mould board plough or work a country plough, so that the plants are uprooted. Engage labour to search pods left out in the soil, if necessary.

NOTE: Do not keep the pulled out plants  in heaps when they are wet, especially  the bunch varieties,  as the pods will start  sprouting.

- v) Strip off the pods from the plants. Groundnut stripper developed by TNAU can be used.
- vi) Dry the pods in the sun for 4 or 5 days. Repeat drying for 2 or 3 more days after an interval of 2 or 3 days to ensure complete drying. When temperature is very high,    avoid    direct    sun  drying.  Collect  the  pods  in  gunnies  and  store  on  the ground over a layer of sand to avoid any moisture coming in contact with dry pods.

## I. Irrigated

## 1. FIELD PREPARATION

- i) Plough  with  tractor  using  a disc followed  by harrow,  once  or twice  with iron  plough  or   3 - 4 times with country plough till all the clods are broken and a fine tilth is obtained.
- ii) Chiselling for soils with hard pan: Chisel the soils having  hard  pan  formation at shallow depth with chisel plough first at 0.5 m interval in one direction and then in the direction perpendicular to the previous one, once in three years. Apply  12.5 t/ha FYM  or composted coir pith besides chiselling.
- iii) Amendments  for  soil  surface  crusting:  a)  To  tide  over  the  surface  crusting, apply  lime @ 2 t/ha along with FYM or composted coir pith @ 12.5 t/ha. b) When  coir  pith  at  12.5  t/ha  is  converted  into  compost  by  inoculating  with Pleurotus and applied, it serves  as  a  good  source of nutrien

## 2. APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS

If soil test is not done, follow the blanket recommendation.

N

P

K

25

50

75 kg/ha

80 kg S as gypsum on 45 DAS

For calcareous soil, application of 40 kg S elemental sulphur along with either 50 kg FeSO4 + 12.5 t FYM or 5 kg Fe EDTA can be used. For sulphur deficient calcareous soil, application of 60 kg S/ha elemental sulphur as basal application is recommended.  Growing CO7, ALR3 and CO2  can  be  recommended  in  calcareous  soils  tolerate  lime  induced  iron  chlorosis  while CO4, TMV2 and ALG320 were highly sensitive to iron deficiency.

N and K in three splits viz., 50 % N &amp; K as basal + 25 % N and K at 20 DAS  + 25 % N and K at 45  DAS is recommended.

Soil test crop response based integrated plant nutrition system (STCRIPNS) recommendation may be adopted for prescribing fertilizer doses for specified yield targets. (ready  reckoners are furnished )

## 3. Forming Beds

Form beds of size 10 m land and type of soil to 20 m depending upon the availability of water, slope of the

- ♦ Wherever tractor is engaged, bed former may be used.  or
- ♦ Ridges and furrows may be laid at 60cm spacing between ridges and sowing taken on both sides of the ridge
- ♦ Raised bed with a width of 60cm and with a furrow of 15cm on either side may be formed and sowing taken on the raised  bed

## 4. POLYTHENE FILM MULCHING

Broad beds and furrows method  of groundnut cultivation is a proven technology  from  ICRISAT. Considering the favourable environment in the Broad beds and furrows system for the development of groundnut pods, with a little modification in the size, beds are to be formed for the polyethylene film mulched groundnut. Make the beds at a width of 60 cm, leaving 15 cm on the either side for the furrows. In a plot size of 4.5 m x 6.0 m, five beds can be made. After the formation of the  bed and fertilizer application, spread black polythene sheet (90 cm width) over the soil surface. The edges of  the  polyethylene  can  be  sheet  Seven  micron  polythene  film  sheet  @50    kg/ha    is required. Holes can be made at required spacing of 30 x10 cm before spreading of the sheets. The seed requirement is similar to normal groundnut cultivation

## 5. APPLICATION OF MICRONUTRIENTS

- · Apply TNAU MN mixture @ 12.5 kg /ha as Enriched FYM . (Prepare  enriched FYM  at 1:10 ratio of MN mixture &amp; FYM ; mix at friable moisture &amp;incubate for one month in shade).
- · Broadcast evenly on the soil surface immediately after sowing. Do not incorporate the micronutrient mixture to the soil.
- · To increase flower retention, pod filling and to induce drought tolerance apart from yield improvement, 2 sprays of TNAU groundnut rich @ 5.0 kg/ha (for  each spray)  at 35 DAS  ( 50  per cent flowering) and 45 DAS (Pod developing stage) in 500 litres of water is recommended

## 6. NUTRITIONAL DISORDER

Zinc deficiency : Apply 25 kg ZnSO4/ha as basal.

If  soil  analysis  shows  less  than  1.2  ppm  of  zinc,  soil  application  of  25  kg  ZnSo   is 4 recommended. Reduce ZnSO4 application from 25.0 kg ha -1 to 12.5 kg ha -1 if FYM is applied @ 12.5 t ha -1. For the standing crop, less than 39.4 ppm of zinc in leaves, foliar spray of 0.5% ZnSo4 is 4 recommended.

Iron deficiency : Foliar spray of 1% FeSO4 + 0.1% citric acid on 30, 40 and 50 days after sowing.  Apply 50 kg FeSO4 + 12.5 t FYM basally.

Boron deficiency :  Application of Borax 10 kg basally (or) 0.2% boric acid twice on 40, 50 DAS.

For multinutrient deficiency: Apply 25 kg ZnSO4 + 10 kg borax + 20kg S as Gypsum.

Copper deficiency: Basal  application  of  10  kg  CuSO   or  0.2%  CuSO .    Spray  twice 4 4 after observing plant nutrient deficiencies.

## 7. SEED RATE

Use 125 kg/ha of kernels. Increase the seed rate by 15% in the case of bold seeded varieties.

## 8. SPACING

Adopt  a  spacing  of  30  cm  between  rows  and  10  cm  between  plants.  Wherever groundnut ring mosaic (bud necrosis) is prevalent, adopt a spacing of 15cm x 15 cm.

## 9. SEED TREATMENT

- i) Treat the seeds with Trichoderma viride @ 4 g/kg seed or Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 g/kg seed.
- Biocontrol agents are compatible with  biofertilizers. First treat the seeds with biocontrol agents and then with Rhizobium . Fungicides and biocontrol agents are incompatible.
- ii) Treatment  with Trichoderma can  be  done  just  before  sowing.  SUCH  SEEDS SHOULD
- NOT BE TREATED WITH FUNGICIDES. (or)
- iii) Treat the seeds with Thiram or Mancozeb @ 4 g/kg of seed or Carboxin or Carbendazim at 2 g/kg of seed.
- iv) Treat the seeds with 3 packets (600 g)/ha of Rhizobial culture TNAU14 developed at TNAU using rice kanji as binder. If the seed treatment is not carried out, apply 10 packets/ha (2000 g) with 25 kg of FYM and 25 kg of soil before  sowing.

Seed treatment will protect the young seedlings from root-rot and collar rot infection.

## 10. SOWING

- a) Dibble the seeds at 4 cm depth along with fertilizer.

## 11. WEED MANAGEMENT

- i. Pre-emergence : Pendimethalin @ 1.0 litre/ha applied on third day after sowing through flat fan nozzle with 500 litres of water/ha followed by irrigation.  After 35 - 40 days  one hand weeding may be  given.
- ii. Spray Early post emergence  application of Imazethapyr @  50  ml/ha 20-30 days after sowing based on weed density as post emergence spray

at

- iii. If  no  herbicide  is  applied  two  hand  hoeing  may  be  given  on  20 th and  40 th day after sowing.
- iv. Apply, PE Oxyfluorfen @ 200 g/ha on 3 rd DAS and followed by one hand weeding on 40-45 DAS
- v. Apply, PE Oxadiazon @ 0.8 kg ha -1 followed by one earthing up using hoes (or) working star type weeder

## 12. EARTHING UP:

Accomplish  earthing  up  during  second  hand  weeding/late  hand  weeding  (in herbicide application).

NOTE: i) Earthing up provides medium for the peg development. ii) Use the improved hoe  with  long  handle  which  can  be  worked  more  efficiently  in  a  standing position. iii) Do not disturb the soil after the 45 th day of sowing as it will affect pod  formation adversely.

## 13. APPLICATION OF CALCIUM SULPHATE (GYPSUM)

-  Apply gypsum @ 400 kg/ha by the side of the plants on the 40 th to 45 th day of sowing. Apply gypsum, hoe and incorporate in the soil and then earth  up.
-  Avoid gypsum in calciferous soils.
-  Gypsum is effective in soils deficient in calcium and sulphur.

NOTE:  Application  of  gypsum  encourages  pod  formation  and  better  filling  up  of  the pods.

Application of gypsum at the rate of 50 % basal both  in  rainfed  and  irrigated condition reduces Khadhasty malady and pod scab nematode

## Combined nutrient spray

Pod filling is a major problem especially in the bold seed varieties. To improve pod filling spraying of nutrient solution is to be given. This can be prepared by soaking DAP 2.5 kg, Ammonium sulphate 1 kg and borax 0.5 kg in 37 lit of water overnight. The next day morning it can be filtered and about 32 litre of mixture can be obtained  and it may be diluted  with  468 lit of water  so as to made  up to 500 litre to spray for one ha. Planofix at the rate of 350 ml. can also be mixed while spraying. This  can be sprayed on 25 th and 35 th day after sowing. or Spray TNAU Groundnut Rich @ 5.5 kg/ha for 2 sprays (50 per cent flowering and pod developing stage) to increase flower retention and pod filling.

## 14. WATER MANAGEMENT

Schedule  the  irrigation  at  0.40  and  0.60  IW/CPE  ratio  during  vegetative  and reproductive  phase  respectively.  Regulate  irrigation  as  per  the  growth  phase  of  the crop. Pre-flowering phase : 1 to 25 days Flowering phase :  26  to  60  days  Maturity phase:  61  to  105 days  Regulate  irrigation  based  on  physiological  growth  phases. Pegging, flowering and  pod  development phases are critical for irrigation during which period adequate soil moisture is essential. Irrigate as follows:

- i) Sowing or pre-sowing
- ii) Life irrigation, 4 - 5 days after sowing.
- iii) 20 days after sowing
- iv) At flowering give two  irrigations
- v) At pegging stage give one or two irrigations
- vi) In pod development stage, 2 - 3 irrigations depending on the soil type

Note: Spraying 0.5% Potassium chloride during flowering and pod development stages

will  aid  to  mitigate  the  ill  effects  of  water  stress.  Sprinkler  irrigation  will  save water  to  the  tune  of  about  30%.  Borderstrip  irrigation  is  recommended  in command areas in light textured soils.  Composted coir pith  increases  moisture availability and better drainage in heavy textured soil.

## 15. HARVESTING

- i) Observe the crop, considering its average duration. Drying and falling of older leaves and yellowing of the top leaves indicate maturity.
- ii) Pull out a few plants at random and shell the pods. If the inner shell is brownish black and not white, then the crop has  matured.
- iii) Irrigate prior to harvest, if the soil is dry, as this will facilitate easy harvesting. If there is enough moisture in the soil, there is no need for irrigation for harvesting.
- iv) If water is not available for irrigating the field prior to harvest, work a mould board plough or work a country plough, so that the plants are uprooted. Engage labour to search pods left out in the soil, if necessary.

NOTE: Do not keep the pulled out plants  in heaps when they are wet, especially  the bunch varieties,  as the pods will start  sprouting.

- v) Strip off the pods from the plants. Groundnut stripper developed by TNAU can be used.
- vi) Dry the pods in the sun for 4 or 5 days. Repeat drying for 2 or 3 more days after an interval of
- 2 or 3 days to ensure complete drying. When temperature is very  high,  avoid direct  sun drying. Collect the pods in gunnies and store on the ground over a layer of sand to avoid any moisture coming in contact with dry pods.

## CROP PHYSIOLOGY

Foliar spray of TNAU Groundnut Rich @ 2 kg/acre in 200 litres of water  at peak flowering   and  at  pod  development  stages  increases  flower  retention,  pod  filling  and improves moisture  stress  tolerance and pod yield.

## Virus multiplication

Collect medium sized larvae of Amsacta albistriga from the field and starve them over night. Make a pure suspension of virus with the nucleus culture in water. Dip Calotropis leaves in virus suspension, shade dry and feed them to starved larvae for 1 or 2 days. From third day, normal, untreated leaves can be fed to these larvae. From 5 th day, the treated larvae will start dying. Virus infected larvae can be  diagnosed  by  their  pinkish  ventral  surface,  their  head  hanging  downwards  with  white  body contents oozing out through ruptured body wall in the late stage. Collect the dying larvae, keep in fresh potable water for a few days, grind the larvae and filter through several layers of fine cloth and collect  filtrate  (Crude  virus  suspension).  Use  virus  suspension  obtained  from  750  medium  sized larvae for spraying one hectare along with a sticker 250 ml or Triton in 350 l of water. Use potable water for mixing and spray in the evening hours.

## GROUNDNUT - VARIETAL SEED PRODUCTION

## Land requirement

- · Land should be free of volunteer plants. The previous crop should not be the same variety or other varieties of the same crop. It can be the same variety if it is certified as per the procedures of certification agency.

## Isolation

- · For certified / quality seed production, leave a distance of 3 m all around the field from the same and other varieties of the crop.

## Season

- · June - July and December - January.

## Spacing

- · 25 x 15 cm.

## Pre-sowing seed hardening

- · Harden the graded seeds by soaking in 0.5 % CaCl2 (50 % seed volume) for 6 h. After 6 h soaking, incubate the seeds in between moist gunny bags for 12 -18 h. Observe the sprouting of radicle periodically at 2 h interval after 12 h of incubation.
- · Separate the seeds with sprouted radicle (just visible expression of radicle) and dry under shade.

## Fertilizer requirement

- · Apply NPK @ 25:50:75 kg / ha as blanket.

- · Apply borax as basal application @ 10 kg / ha in boron deficient soils.
- · Apply gypsum @ 400 kg / ha at peg formation stage and at earthing.

## Foliar application

- · NAA@  200  ppm  at  60  days  after  sowing  to  arrest  late  formed  flowers  and increase the seed yield in groundnut.

## Pre-harvest spray to arrest in situ germination

- · Spray 1250 ppm MH (Maleic Hydrazide) at 60 days after sowing.

## Harvest

- · Harvest the pods as and when the colour of the inner side of the shell turns black and dry to 10 - 12 per cent moisture.

## Drying

- · Stake the plants as the pods are exposed outside for easy drying of pods.
- · Dry the pods to 15 - 20 % moisture content under sun.

## Decortication

- · Dry  the  pods  to  16  per  cent  moisture  content  and  decorticate  either  manually  or using hand operated decorticator with proper adjustment.
- · Dry the kernels to 7 to 8 per cent moisture.
- · Practice  pod  verification  based  on  varietal  characteristic  before  grading  to  remove genetically impure seeds.
- · Remove all discoloured pods.
- · Reject mechanically injured pods for seed purpose.

## Pre-storage seed treatment

- · Treat the pods with carbendazim @ 2 g / kg at 6 - 7 % moisture content.

## Seed storage

- · Store the pods in gunny bags with calcium chloride @ 250 g / 30 kg of pods.
- · Store the seeds in gunny for short term storage (8 - 9 months) with a seed moisture content of 8 - 9 %.
- · Store  the  seeds  in  polylined  gunny  bag  for  medium  term  storage  (12  -  15  months) with a seed moisture content of 6 - 8 %.
- · Store  the  seeds  in  700  gauge  polythene  bag  for  long  term  storage  (more  than  15 months) with a seed moisture content less than 5 %.

## 1.

## CROP MANAGEMENT FIELD PREPARATION

- a) Plough the field with tractor twice or with mould board plough  thrice  or five times  with a  country plough.
- b) Break  the  clods  in  between  ploughings  and  bring  the  soil  to  a  fine  tilth  to facilitate quick germination as the seeds are small.
- c) Chiselling for soils with hard pan: Chisel the soils having hard pan formation at shallow depth with chisel plough first at 0.5 m interval in one direction and then in  the  direction  perpendicular to the previous one once in three years. Apply 12.5t FYM/composted coir pith besides chiselling.
- d) For irrigated gingelly, form beds of size 10 m  or 20 m  depending  upon  the 2 2 availability,    inflow  of  water  and  slope  of  the  land.  Level  the  beds  perfectly without  any  depressions  to  prevent  water  stagnation,  which  will  affect  the germination  adversely.
- e) In rice fallows, field is ploughed once with optimum moisture, seeds  are sown immediately and covered with one more  ploughing.

## 2. APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS

- i) Spread  FYM  or  composted  coir  pith  or  compost  @  12.5  t/ha  evenly  on  the unploughed field and plough it in.
- ii) If  the  manure is not applied before commencement of ploughing, spread 12.5 t/ha  of  FYM  or  compost  evenly  on  the  field  before  the  last  ploughing  and incorporate in the soil.
- iii) If  soil  tests  are  not  available,  follow  the  blanket  recommendations. Rainfed: Apply 23:13:13  kg NPK/ha or 17:13:13 kg NPK/ ha + 3 packets of Azospirillum (600 g/ha) and 3 packets (600 g/ha) of Phosphobacteria or 6 packets of Azophos (1200  g/ha). Irrigated: Apply  35:23:23  kg  NPK/ha  or  21:23:23  kg  NPK/ha  +  3 packets of Azospirillum (600 g/ha) and 3 packets (600 g/ha) of Phosphobacteria or 6 packets of Azophos (1200  g/ha)

- * Maintenance dose

**Maximum dose

Note: FN, FP2O5 and K2O  are fertilizer N, P2O5 and K2O in kg ha -1 , respectively; T is the yield target in q ha -1 ; SN, SP and SK respectively are available N,P and K in kg ha -1 and ON, OP and OK are the quantities of N, P and K supplied through organic manure inkg ha -1 . Open furrows to a depth of 5 cm and 30 cm apart and place the fertilizer mixture along the furrows and cover to a depth of 3 cm with soil before sowing.

- iv) If  furrow application is not done, broadcast the fertilizer mixture evenly on the beds before sowing.
- v) Apply TNAU MN mixture @ 7.5 kg/ha as enriched FYM for rainfed sesame and TNAU MN mixture @ 12.5 kg/ha as enriched FYM for irrigated sesame. (Prepare enriched FYM at 1:10 ratio of MN mixture and FYM; mix at friable moisture and incubate for one month in shade)

## 3. APPLICATION OF AZOSPIRILLUM

- a) Treat one hectare of seeds with 600 g of Azospirillum and 600g of phosphobacteria (or) 600g of Azophos. Apply 2 kg of Azospirillum and  2  kg  of phosphobacteria (or)  2 kg of Azophos with 25 kg of FYM and 25 kg of sand,   mix uniformly before sowing as soil application.
- b) Liquid formulation Treat one hectare of seeds with 125 ml of Azospirillum and 125 ml of Phosphobacteria,  shade dry it for 30 minutes before sowing.

## 4. NUTRITIONAL DISORDERS

- a) Manganese deficiency : Leaves develop interveinal  chlorosis,  chlorotic  tissue, later develop light brown or husk coloured necrotic  lesions.  Mix 10 kg MnSO4 /ha with  45 kg of  soil and broadcost evely in the beds after sowing.
- b) Zinc deficiency : Middle leaves develop chlorosis in the  interveinal  areas  and necrosis along the apical leaf margins. Apply 25 kg Zinc sulphate with 45 kg of soil and broadcast evenly in the beds after  sowing.

Note: Do not incorporate the micronutrient in the soil.

## 5. SEED RATE

Adopt a seed rate of 5 kg/ha.

## 6. SPACING

a)  Give  a  spacing  of  30  cm  between  rows  and  30  cm  between plants. b) For rice fallows, seeds are broadcasted and thinned to maintain 11 plants/m 2

## 7. QUALITY OF SEEDS

Select mature, good quality seeds free from pest and fungal damage.

## 8. SEED TREATMENT

Treat the seed with Trichoderma @ 4g/kg. This can be done just  before  sowing. SUCH    SEEDS  SHOULD  NOT  BE  TREATED  WITH  FUNGICIDES  or  treat  the  seed  with Thiram 4 g or Carbendazim at 2 g/kg of seeds before sowing.

## 9. SOWING

- a) Sow the seeds preferably in lines.
- b) Mix  the  seeds  with  four  times  its  volume  of  dry  sand  and  drop  the  mixture evenly along the furrows in which fertilizers are  applied.
- c) Sow the seeds to a depth of 3 cm and cover with soil.
- d) The  optimum  time  of  sowing  for  VRI  (SV)  1  sesame  is  second  fortnight  of February to first fortnight of March under summer irrigated conditions.

## 10. WATER MANAGEMENT

- i) Irrigate at sowing and give life irrigation 7 days after sowing depending on the soil and climatic condition and allow excess water to percolate.
- ii) Give one pre-flowering irrigation (25 days): One at flowering and one or two at pod setting. An irrigation at flowering period is critical.

NOTE:  The  critical  stage  for  moisture  requirement  is  the  flowering  phase    i.e, between  35th   to  45th    days  of  sowing.  During  the  maturity  phase,  moisture status should be low. If more water  is  given during this phase, maturity of seeds is affected  and filling  up of the capsules  will be  poor. Therefore, stop irrigation after 65 days of sowing.

## 11. THINNING

Thin out the seedlings to a spacing of 15 cm between  the plants  on the  15th day of sowing and 30 cm on 30th day of sowing. This operation is very important  for the  crop  in order  to induce basal branches.

## 12. WEED MANAGEMENT

- i. Apply, PE application of Pendimethalin 1.0 litre /ha followed by one hand weeding on 25 th DAS

## 13. HARVESTING

## a) Decide when to harvest

- i. Observe the crop, considering the average duration of the  crop.
- ii. Twenty five per cent of the leaves from the bottom are shed and the top leaves

loose their colour and turn yellow at  maturity.

- iii. The colour of the stem turns  yellow.
- iv. The colour of the capsules turn yellow upto the middle.
- v. Harvest before the bottom capsules turn brown.
- vi. Examine  the 10 th capsule  from the bottom  by opening.  If the seeds  attained the full color   of the variety harvest may be taken up.
- vii. If harvest is delayed/ the capsules will dehisce resulting in yield reduction.

## b) Harvest

- i. Pull out the plants from the  bottom.
- ii. Stack in the open, one over the other in a circle with the stems pointing out and the top portion pointing inside.
- iii. Cover the top with straw, so that humidity and  temperature increases.
- iv. Cure like this for 3 days, shake the plants. About 75 per cent of the seeds will fall off.
- v. Dry the plants for one more day and again shake the plants. All the mature seeds will fall off.
- vi. Winnow the seeds and dry in the sun for 3 days. Stir once in 3 hours to give uniform drying.
- vii. Collect the seeds and store in  gunnies.

## SESAME - VARIETAL SEED PRODUCTION

## Land requirement

- · Land should be free of volunteer plants. The previous crop should not be the same variety or other varieties of the same crop. It can be the same variety if it is certified as per the procedures of certification agency.

## Isolation

- · For certified quality seed production, leave a distance of 200 m all around the field from the same and other varieties of the crop.

## Pre- sowing seed treatment

Pellet  the  seeds  with  neem  leaf  powder  @  760  g  +  120  g  Azotobacter  +  120  g phosphobacteria for 1 kg seed to enhance the productivity.

## Fertilizer

- · Apply  NPK  @  50:25:25  kg  /  ha  and  Manganese  sulphate  @  5  kg  /  ha  as  basal application.

## Foliar application

- · Spray 1 % DAP at the time of first flowering and 10 days after the first spray.

## Harvest

- · Harvest the crop when 75 - 80 % of the pods started yellowing and bottom 1 or 2 pods have dehisced. At this stage, the pod moisture content will be 50 - 60 % and seed moisture content will be 25 - 30 % and the seeds will be chocolate brown colour.
- · Stake the plants in inverted position and cure them for 3 - 4 days.

## Threshing

- · Beat the staked plants with pliable bamboo stick for removal of seeds.

## Seed grading

- · Grade the seeds with 4 / 64' round perforated sieve.

## Drying

- · Dry the seeds to 7- 8 % moisture content.

## Pre-storage seed treatment

- · Treat the seeds with carbendazim @ 2 g / kg along with carbaryl 200 mg / kg of seed.
- · Treat  seeds  with  halogen  mixture  (CaOCl2  +  CaCO3  +  arappu  ( Albizzia  amara) leaf powder mixed in the ratio of 5:4:1 @ 3 g / kg as eco-friendly treatment.

## Storage

- · Store the seeds in gunny or cloth bags for short term storage (8 - 9 months) with a seed moisture content of 8 - 9 %.
- · Store  the  seeds  in  polylined  gunny  bag  for  medium  term  storage  (12  -  15  months) with a seed moisture content of 6 - 7 %.
- · Store  the  seeds  in  700  gauge  polythene  bag  for  long  term  storage  (more  than  15 months) with seed moisture content less than 5 %.

̊

Tropical and requires moderately high temperature 20 to 27 C with low humidity throughout the  growing  season.  It  grows  best  in  areas  where  there  are  clear  warm  sunny  days. Prolonged cloudy weather with high temperature at the time of flowering resulted in poor seed setting, which is known as sex reversion. High temperature above 41 C at flowering o time even for as short period results in blasting of flowers. Very resistant to drought but evenly  distributed  rainfall  is  required.  Heavy  rainfall  at  flowering  reduces  the  yield.  Very susceptible to frost but grow even an altitudes of 1200 to 2100 m, if sown in March- April, perennial varieties are grown at still higher altitude for shade in coffee estates.

## 6. PRE TREATMENT OF SEEDS

- a) Treat the seeds with Thiram or carbendazim @ 2g / kg of seeds or with Trichoderma viride @ 4g/kg of seeds.  Treat the seed 24 hours prior to sowing. Soaking the seeds with water for 10 hours enhances the germination.

b) In rainfed situations, seed priming with 1% KCl for 3 hours and sowing a week before onset of monsoon is recommended.

## 7. SOWING

a) Sow the seeds adopting the recommended spacing. b) Place the seeds at depth 4 - 6 cm. c) Put two seeds in each hole and retain only one healthy seedling by thinning out of weaker seedling/pistillate plant at 20 DAS.

## Selective mechanization

Selective  mechanization  in  castor viz .,  sowing  with  tractor  drawn  seed  drill  with  a spacing of 120 cm x 90 cm, inter cultivation with power weeder on 20 and 40 DAS, need based plant protection with boom sprayer, harvesting by secateurs and threshing and shelling by castor thresher increased the kernel yield and net return &amp; benefit cost ratio

## 8. GAP FILLING

Gap fill on the 15 th day of sowing and simultaneously thinning may be done leaving one healthy plant.

## 9. WEED MANAGEMENT

Apply pre emergence herbicide Pendimethalin @ 1 litre/ha or Fluchloralin @ 1 litre/ha on 3 DAS followed by hand weeding twice on 20 th &amp; 40 th DAS.

## 10. CASTOR PGR CONSORTIA (CASTOR GOLD)

Foliar  application  of  plant  growth  regulator  consortia  @  0.05  %  (0.5  ml/litre  of water) on 25 and 60 days after sowing for increasing pistillate flower production, seed setting per cent and seed yield.

## 11. NIPPING

For perennial castor variety YTP 1, nipping of primary shoot at 10 th internode using secateurs is recommended for tripling the productive branches.

## 12. INTERCROPPING

Raise one row of castor for every six rows of groundnut. In the case of late receipt of monsoon blackgram + castor at 6:1 ratio is  recommended. Or Intercropping of  castor with Blackgram or Greengram in 1:2 ratio is recommended for rainfed situation.

Intercropping of castor with small onion in 1:2 ratio by adopting 1.5 m x 1.0 m spacing is recommended for irrigated situation.

For  hilly  areas  of  Tamil  Nadu viz .,  Kalrayan  hills,  Javadhu  hills  and  Yelagiri  hills,  Samai (10kg/ha) + Castor 1.0 kg/ha) @ 10:1 ratio-line sowing (25cm x10 cm) with 50 % organic (FYM @ 8.0t/ha) and 50 % inorganic nutrient (22:11 kg N &amp; P/ha) is recommended for realizing maximum profit.

## 13. HARVESTING THE CROP

Observe  the  crop  considering  the  average  duration  of  the  variety.    i)  One  or  more capsules  show  sign  of  drying.  ii)  Cut  the  matured  racemes  without  damaging  the secondaries. iii) Dry the capsule in the sun without heaping it in the shade. iv) Use castor sheller to separate the seeds or beat the dried capsule with wooden planks, winnow and collect the seeds.

For  YRCH  1,  first  harvest  has  to  be  done  on  90  DAS,  subsequently  second  and  third harvest is to be carried out on 120 and 150 DAS, respectively.

For  YRCH  2,  first  harvest  has  to  be  done  on  110  DAS  followed  by  second  and  third harvest is to be taken on 140 and 170 DAS, respectively.

The harvested spike should be sun dried and dried capsules can be shelled in the sheller.

## Spacing

- · 90 X 30 cm.

## Harvesting

- · Harvest the racemes as once over harvest when 80 % of the capsules turn to brown colour.
- · The seeds from secondary raceme are better than primary and others.

## Threshing

- · Shell  the  seeds  either  using  power  operated  thresher  or  manually  by  beating  with pliable bamboo stick.
- · Avoid hand operated thresher to reduce the mechanical damage.

## Seed grading

- · Grade the seeds using 18 / 64' round perforated sieve.

## Pre-storage seed treatment

- · Treat the seeds with carbendazim @ 2 g / kg of seed.
- · Treat  seeds  with  halogen  mixture  (CaOCl2  +  CaCO3  +  arappu  ( Albizzia  amara )  leaf powder mixed in the ratio of 5:4:1@ 3 g / kg of seed as eco-friendly treatment.
- · Mix the seeds with dry sweet flag (or) vasambu ( Achorus calamus) rhizome powder at the ratio of 1:100 for grain cum seed storage.

## Storage

- · Store the seeds in gunny or cloth bags for short term storage (8 - 9 months) with a seed moisture content of 8 - 9 %.
- · Store  the  seeds  in  polylined  gunny  bag  for  medium  term  storage  (12  -  15  months) with a seed moisture content of 7 - 8 %.
- · Store  the  seeds  in  700  gauge  polythene  bag  for  long  term  storage  (more  than15 months) with a seed moisture content less than 5 %.

## CROP MANAGEMENT

## 1. FIELD PREPARATION

Plough once with tractor  or twice  with iron-plough  or three to four times with country-plough  till all the clods are broken and a fine tilth is obtained.

## 2. APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS

- i) Spread 12.5 t/ha of FYM or compost or composted coir pith evenly on the field before  the  last  ploughing  and  incorporate  in  the  soil  by  working  a  country plough.
- If soil test recommendations are not available, follow the blanket NPK/ha for both irrigated and rainfed crops.

|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Varieties | 7 kg/ha   | 6 kg/ha     |
| Hybrids   | 5 kg/ha   | 5 kg/ha     |

## 6.  SEED TREATMENT

Soaking seeds in 2% for 12 hrs and shade drying is recommended for rainfed ZnSO4 sowing.

## 7. SEED TREATMENT

- i) Treat the seed with Trichoderma @4g/kg. This can be done just before sowing. It  is  compatible  with  biofertilizers.  Such  seeds  should  not  be  treated  with fungicides.
- ii) Treat the seeds with Carbendazim or Thiram at 2 g/kg of  seed.
- iii) Treat the seeds 24 hours prior to  sowing.
- iv) Treat the seeds required for sowing 1 ha with 600 g of Azospirillum and 600g of phosphobacteria (or) 600g of Azophos using rice gruel as binder, shade dry the treated seeds for 30 min and sow immediately.
- Liquid formulation Treat one hectare of seeds with 125 ml of Azospirillum and 125 ml of Phosphobacteria,  shade dry it for 30 minutes before sowing
- v) Moist hydration for 24 hours in moist gunny bags followed by drying and seed dressing with Thiram @ 2g/kg to enhance field emergence.
- vi) Seeds  dried  to  8  -  9%  moisture  content,  treated  with  Thiram  @  2g/kg    and packed  in  polylined (300 guage) cloth bag can store upto 9 months with 70% germination.

## 8. SOWING

Spacing  :

Hybrids :  60 cm x 30cm

Varieties  :

45 cm x 30cm

- i) Place  the  seeds  at  a  depth  of  3  cm  along  the  furrows  in  which  the  fertilizer mixture is placed. Put two seeds per hole

## 9. THINNING

Thin out seedlings leaving only one healthy and vigorous  seedling  in each hole on the 10 th day of sowing.

## 10.WEED MANAGEMENT

- i) Apply  Fluchloralin  @  1.0  lit/ha  before  sowing    and  incorporate    or  apply  as pre-emergence    spray  on 3 rd day  after  sowing  followed  by  irrigation  or  apply Pendimethalin  @  1.0  litre/ha  as  pre-  emergence  spray  3  days  after  sowing.  The spray  of these  herbicides  has to be accomplished with Knapsack sprayer fitted with flat fan nozzle using 500  lit  water/ha  as spray fluid.
- All  the  herbicide  application  is  to  be  followed  by  one  late  hand  weeding  30  -  35 days  after  sowing.
- After  application  of  pre  emergence  herbicide,  instead  of  hand  weeding,  power weeder can be used if sowing was done with the spacing of 75 x 25 cm.
- ii) If pre emergence herbicide was not applied, hand weeding to be done on on 15 th and 30 th day after sowing and remove  the  weeds.

## 11.WATER MANAGEMENT

Irrigate immediately after sowing followed  by an irrigation  on 4 - 5 th day and later  at  interval    of  7  to  8  days  according  to  soil  and  climatic  conditions  at  seeding, flowering  and  seed  development stage.

## 12.FOLIAR SPRAY OF NAPHTHALENE ACETIC ACID (NAA)

- i) Foliar spray of Napthalene Acetic Acid (NAA) at 20 ppm concentration (280 g NAA in 625 litres of water per ha) on the 30th and 60th day of sowing.
- ii) Use a high volume sprayer and give a thorough coverage of the entire plant.
- iii) Do not use brackish  water.

## 13.SULPHUR FERTILIZATION

Apply  sulphur  @  20  kg/ha  through  ammonium  sulphate  or  single  super phosphate. Or apply gypsum@ 200kg/ha as basal

## 14.BORIC ACID

Foliar  spray  of  boric  acid  @  0.2  %  (2g/l  of  water)  to  capitulum  at  ray  floret opening stage to improve  seed  set and seed filling.

## 15.IMPROVING SEED SET BY MECHANICAL MEANS

- a. During the mid flowering phase, improve pollination by :
- i. Mild rubbing of the capitulum with the hand covered with soft cloth or ii. Rubbing two flowers face to face gently.
- iii. The  mid-flowering  phase  are:  58  to  60  days  of  planting  for  long  duration varieties, 45 to 48 days of planting for short duration varieties
- iv. .Do  this  operation  in  the  morning  hours  between  9.0  and  11.00  am  when pollen shedding is high.
- b. Keeping bee hives at the rate of 5/ha improves seed setting.

## 16.JUDGE WHEN TO HARVEST

Observe the bracts on the backside of the capitula. When they turn lemon yellow, the heads harden and the crop is ready for harvest.

Bird  damage:  Use  of  reflective  ribbons  scares  the  birds  effectively    and  thus prevents  loss of  grain.

## 17.HARVESTING

- i. Cut the capitula (flower heads)  only
- ii. Thresh and clean
- a. Immediately after harvest, dry the heads in the sun for 3  days.
- b. Spread the heads in thin layer and give turning once in 3 hours.
- NOTE:  Do  not  heap  or  store  the  heads  before  drying  properly    as  mould  fungi  will develop and spoil   the grain quality.
- c. Thresh  using  a  mechanical  thresher,  or  beat  with  a  stick  and  separate  the grains.
- d. Winnow and clean the seeds
- e. Dry the seeds again in the sun for another two days
- f. Store in gunny bags

## CROP MANAGEMENT

## Soil

Red sandy loam, laterite and alluvial soils are suitable. Heavy, imperfectly drained soil is unsuitable.

## Seasons

June-July, December - January. The planting can also be taken up in  other  seasons wherever irrigation and drainage facilities are available.

## Spacing

Adopt a spacing of 25' x 25' (7.5 x 7.5 m) with 175 plants/ha. For planting in field border as a single row, adopt 20' spacing between plants.

## Planting

Dig pit size of 3' x 3' x 3'. In the pits, sprinkle Lindane 1.3 % D to prevent white ant damage. Fill the pit to a height of two feet (60 cm) with FYM, red earth and sand mixed in equal proportions. At the center of the pit, remove the soil mixture and plant the seedling after removing all the roots. Press the soil well around the seedling and provide the seedling

with  shade  by  using  plaited  coconut  leaves  or  palmyrah  leaves.  Keep  the  pits  free  from weeds. Remove soil covering the collar region.  As the seedlings grow and form stem, fill up the pits gradually by cutting the sides.

## Water management

From 5 th year onwards, adopt the following irrigation schedule based on pan evaporation for drip irrigation and basin irrigation.

For drip irrigation, open four pits size of 30 x 30 x 30 cm opposite to each other at one meter distance from the trunk. Place 40 cm long PVC conduit pipe (16 mm) in a slanting position in each pit and place the drippers inside the conduit tube and allow the water to drip  30  cm below  the  soil surface. Fill the pits with coir pith to prevent  evaporation.In the first year, irrigate on alternate days and from the second year to the time of maturity irrigate twice in a week based on the water requirement.

## Drought management and soil moisture conservation Mulching with coconut husks/leaves/coir pith

Apply coconut husks with convex surface facing upwards (100 Nos.) or dried coconut

leaves (15 Nos) or coir pith up to a height of 10 cm in the basin of 1.8 m radius  around  the palms as mulch  for soil moisture conservation particularly during summer season.

## Burial of coconut husk or coir pith

Husk burial can be done in coconut basins or in the interspaces to overcome drought and button shedding. Bury husks @ 100 Nos. with concave surface facing upwards or 25 kg of coir pith/palm in circular trenches, dug 30 cm width and 60 cm depth at 1.5 metres radius. The husk can be also buried in the trenches at a distance of 3 m from the palm with a size of 45 cm deep and 150 cm width in between two rows of coconut. The soaking of the coconut husk or coir pith as the case may be preserves the monsoon rains.

## Manuring

From 5 th year onwards, apply 50 kg of FYM or compost or green manure.1.3 kg Urea (560 g N), 2.0 kg Superphosphate (320 g P2O5) and 2.0 kg Muriate of potash (1200 g K2O) in two equal splits during June - July and December - January.  Apply manures and fertilizers in circular basins of 1.8 m from the base of the palm, incorporate and irrigate. During 2nd, 3rd and  4th  year  ¼,  ½  and  ¾  doses  of  the  above  fertilizer  schedule  should  be  adopted respectively. Sufficient moisture should be present at the time of manuring. Fertigation may be done at monthly intervals with 75% of the recommended dose of the above fertilizers. Phosphorous may be applied as super phosphate in the basins and incorporated or as DAP through  drip  when  good  quality  of  water  is  available.  TNAU  micronutrient  mixture  is recommended @ 1.0kg/tree/year.

## TNAU coconut tonic nutrition

For  nut  bearing  coconut  Palm,  root  feed  TNAU  coconut  tonic  @200ml/palm  once  in  six months.

## Bio-fertilizer recommendation

At  the  time  of  planting,  apply  50g  of Azospirillum, 50  g  of  Phosphobacteria  (or)  50  g  of Azophos and 50 g of AM fungi. Mix all the contents with sufficient quantity of FYM or any compost. After planting apply the above biofertilizers once in 6 months/palm near to the feeding roots as that of fertilizer application

## Organic recycling

Any one of the green manure crops like sunnhemp, wild indigo, calapagonium or daincha may be sown and ploughed in situ at the time of flowering as a substitute of compost to be applied.  Sow sunnhemp @ 50 g/palm in the basin and incorporate before flowering. Coir pith  compost/vermicompost  made  from  coir  pith/  coconut  leaves/  other  wastes  from coconut grove can be applied.

## Intercultural operation weed management

The interspace in the coconut garden has to be ploughed twice in a year in June-July and December  -  January.  Intercultural  operation  is  essential  to  keep  weed  population  under check,  to  enhance  the  utilisation  of  the  applied  plant  nutrients  by  the  coconut  trees,  to facilitate proper aeration to the roots of coconut, to induce fresh root growth.

## Weed management

For  the  broad-leaved  weeds,  pre-emergence  spraying  of  atrazine  @1.0    kg  /  ha    for    the control of grasses and sedges, post emergence spraying of glyphosate @ 10 -15 ml and 20 g Ammonium sulphate + 2 ml soap solution /litre of water.

## Inter cropping

Inter/mixed  crops  may  be  selected  based  on  the  climatic  requirement  of  the inter/mixed crop, irrigation facilities and soil type. The canopy size, age and spacing of the coconut  are  also  to  be  considered.  Market  suitability  should  be  taken  into  consideration before selecting an intercrop.

Below 7 years of age : Any suitable annual crop for particular soil type and climatic condition may  be  raised  as  intercrops  upto  5  years  after  planting  depending  upon  the  canopy coverage.  Groundnut,  sesamum,  sunflower,  tapioca,  turmeric  and  banana  can  be  grown. Avoid crops like paddy and sugarcane etc.

7 - 20 years of age : Green manure crops and fodder crops (Napier grass and guinea  grass) alone can be grown.

Above  20  years  of  age (20  years  of  age  has  to  be  adjusted  based  on  the  sunlight transmission of above 50% inside the canopy).

The following crops can be grown depending on the soil and climatic suitability.

(i) Annuals

:

Groundnut, bhendi, turmeric, tapioca, sweetpotato, sirukizhangu, elephant foot yam, ginger,  pineapple

(ii) Biennials : Banana varieties, poovan and monthan are suitable.

(iii) Perennials :

Cocoa*, pepper* (Panniyur 1 or Panniyur 2 or Panniyur 5 or Karimunda), nutmeg* and vanilla*

*Suitable  areas  are  Pollachi  tract  of  western  region  and  Kanyakumari  district.  For vanilla, use disease free planting material and maintain high vigilance to maintain a disease free crop.

## Multiple cropping system

Coconut + banana + sirukizhangu + bhendi is suitable system for the eastern region. Crops  like  banana,  pepper,  cocoa,  nutmeg,  vanilla  can  be  tried  under  multiple  cropping system  in  suitable  areas  in  the  western  region.  In  all  the  systems,  apply  recommended quantity of water and manures and fertilizers to the intercrops  separately.

## Crop physiology

Root  feeding  of  TNAU  coconut  tonic  @  200  ml  /  palm  twice  a  year  at  six  months interval decreases button shedding and increases the number and size of nuts.

## Diseases management

## Basal stem rot ( Ganoderma lucidum )

- · Aureofungin-sol @ 2g + copper sulphate @ 1g dissolved in 100 ml water or hexaconazole @ 2 ml with 100 ml of water, applied as root feeding for 3 times at 3 months interval. (The active absorbing root of pencil thickness be selected and a slanting cut is made. The solution is taken in a polythene bag or bottle and the cut end of the root is dipped in the solution)
- · Forty liters of 1% Bordeaux mixture should be applied as soil drench around the trunks in a radius of 1.5 meter
- · Neem cake  @  5  kg/tree  can  be  applied  along  with  fertilizers  and  azotobactor  @  200 g/tree

## Bud rot ( Phytophthora palmivora )

- · The infected tissues from the crown region should be removed and protected with Bordeaux paste
- · Spray 1% bordeaux mixture  or copper oxychloride @ 0.25 % on crown region as premonsoon spray
- · Spray copper oxychloride @ 0.25 % after the onset of monsoon

## Stem bleeding ( Ceratocystis paradoxa )

The bark of the trunk should be removed in the bleeding area and Bordeaux paste should be applied in this area

## Preparation of 1% bordeaux mixture

Copper sulphate @ 400g should be dissolved in 20 litres of water and 400 g of lime in another 20 litres of water separately. The copper sulphate solution should be added to the lime  solution  constantly  stirring  the  mixture.  Earthen  or  wooden  vessels  alone  should  be used  and  metallic  containers  should  not  be  used.  To  find  out  whether  the  mixture  is  in correct  proportion,  a  polished  knife  should  be  dipped  in  the  mixture  for  one  minute  and taken out. If there is reddish brown deposit of copper, additional quantity of lime should be added till there is no deposit in the knife.

## Preparation of bordeaux paste:

Take 200 g of copper sulphate and dissolve it in one litre of water and 200 g of lime in  one  litre  of  water  separately,  both  are  mixed  simultaneously  in  a  third  vessel  and  the resultant mixture can be used as a paste.

## SPECIAL PROBLEMS IN COCONUT

## Rejuvenation of existing garden

The low yield in vast majority of gardens is due to thick population, lack of manuring and irrigation. These gardens could be improved if the following measures are taken.

## i. Thinning of thickly populated gardens

In the farmer's holdings where thick planting is adopted, many trees give an yield of less than 20 nuts/palm/year. By cutting and removal of these trees, the yield could be increased. Besides, there is saving in the cost of cultivation and increase in net profit. After  removal  of  low  yielding  trees,  the  populations    should    be    maintained  at  175 palms/ha.

## ii. Ensuring adequate manuring and irrigation :

The  yield  can  be  increased  in  the  existing  gardens  when  manuring  +  irrigation  + cultural practice is adopted as per recommendation.

## Pencil point disorder (Micronutrient deficiency)

Because  of  micronutrient  deficiency,  the  stem  will  taper  towards  its  tip  with lesser number of leaves. The leaf size will be greatly reduced and the leaves will be pale and yellow in colour.  Along with the recommended fertilizer dose, 225 g each of Borax, Zinc sulphate, Manganese sulphate, Ferrous sulphate, Copper sulphate and 10 g of Ammonium molybdate may be dissolved in 10 litres of water and poured in the basin of 1.8 m radius. This disorder can be corrected if noticed early.  Severely affected palms may be removed and replanted with new seedlings.

## Button shedding

Shedding of buttons and premature nuts may be due to any one of the following reasons:

- i) Excess acidity or alkalinity
- ii) Lack of drainage
- iii) Severe drought
- iv) Genetic  causes
- v) Lack of nutrients
- vi) Lack of pollination

- vii) Hormone deficiency
- viii) Pests
- ix) Diseases

The following remedial measures are suggested.

## Rectification of soil pH

Excess acidity or alkalinity  of soil may cause  button shedding.  If the soil pH is less than 5.5, it is an indication of excess acidity. This could be rectified by adding lime. Increase in  alkalinity  is  indicated  by  soil  pH  higher  than  8.0.  This  situation  could  be  rectified  by adding gypsum.

## Providing adequate drainage  facilities

Lack of drainage results in the roots of coconut trees getting suffocated for want of aeration. Shedding of buttons occur under such condition. Drainage channels have to  be dug  along  the contours to drain the excess water during rainy season.

## Management of young coconut gardens under waterlogged  conditions

- (i) A trench between two rows of young coconut palms should be dug during onset of the monsoon rains. The size of the trench is 3 m width, 30 - 45 cm depth to entire length of field. The soil excavated from the trench should be placed along  the rows  of palms  to make a  raised bed.
- (ii) Form mound around the young palms to a radius of 1.2 m width with height of 30 -45 cm.

## Genetic causes

In some trees button shedding may persist even after ensuring adequate manuring, irrigation and crop pest and disease management. This is an indication of inherent defect of the mother  palm  from which the seed material was obtained. This underlines the need for proper  choice  of  superior  mother  palm  for  harvesting  seed  coconut  to  ensure  uniformly good yielding trees.

## Lack of nutrition

Button shedding occurs due to inadequate or lack of manuring. The recommended dose of manurial schedules and proper time of application are important to minimise  the button  shedding. Apply extra 2 kg of muriate of potash with 200 g of Borax/palm over and above the usual dosage of fertilizer  to correct  the barren  nuts  in coconut  for period  of 3 years.

## Boron deficiency or crown choke disorder

Apply 200 g of borax/palm/year in two splits.

## Lack of pollination

Button shedding also occurs due to lack of pollination. Setting up of beehives @ 15 units/ha may increase the cross pollination in the garden. Further the additional  income obtained  through honey, increases the net profit per unit area.

## Hormone deficiency

The fertilised female flowers i.e., buttons  shed in some cases.  By spraying 2, 4- D at 30 ppm or NAA 20 ppm (30 mg per litre of water) on the inflorescence one month after opening of the spathe, the setting percentage could be  increased.

## Pests

Button  shedding  may  happen  due  to  the  attack  of  bug.  Spraying  of  systemic insecticides like Methyldematon 0.025% (1ml/lit) or Dimethoate 0.03% (1ml/lit) may reduce the occurrence.

## Diseases

Button  shedding  also  occurs  due  to  disease  incidence  such  as  basal  stem  rot. Adoption  of  control  measures  suggested  for  the  disease  reduces  not  only  spread  of  the disease but also prevents shedding of buttons.

## Coconut mother palm selection and nursery  management

The  need  for  collecting  seed  materials  from  high  yielding  coconut  palms  is  highly essential in a perennial crop like coconut.

The following points may be remembered.

## Mother palm selection

- 1. Select seed  gardens,  which  contain  large  proportion  of  high  yielding  trees  with uniformity in yielding ability. Trees growing closer to households, cattle shed, compost pits and other favorable conditions should be  avoided.
- 2. High yielding mother palms giving not less than 100nuts/palm/annum should be chosen for  collecting  seednuts.  Alternate  bearers  should  be  avoided.  The  age  of  the  palm chosen be middle age i.e.,  from  25  to  40  years.  Even  trees  with  15  years  age  can  be selected, if it is high yielding and has stabilized  yield.
- 3. The mother palm should have straight trunk, spherical  or semi spherical  crown,  high rate  of    leaf  and  spathe  production,  short  and  stout  petiole,  more  number  of  female flowers regular bearing habit, non - buckling bunches, high setting parentage, medium in nut size, high copra outturn and free from pest and diseases. A good regular bearing mother  palm  produces  on  an  average  one  leaf  and  an  inflorescence  in  its  axil  every month. So, there will be twelve bunches of varying stages of maturity at any one time. Avoid trees producing habitually barren nuts.
- 4. Harvest seednuts during the months of February - August to get maximum germination and good quality seedlings. Harvest the bunches intended for seednut by lowering them to the ground using a rope to avoid injury to seednuts
- 5. The  seednuts  should  be  round  in  shape  and  when  tapped  by  finger  should  produce metallic sound. Fully ripe nuts develop twelve months after fertilisation.
- 6. To get more quality seedlings, the seednuts of tall and hybrid are to  be  air cured  for one  month followed by sand curing for two months. For dwarf varieties, the air curing should be lesser than one month followed by sand curing for two months.

## Nursery management

- 1. Select nursery area in a well drained plot with coarse texture soil near water source for irrigation. Nursery can be raised in the open space with artificial shade or in the adult coconut garden.
- 2. Plant seednuts in long and narrow beds at a spacing of 30 x 30 cm either horizontally or vertically  in  deep  trenches  with  20-25  cm  depth.  Five  rows  of  nuts  may  be  planted  in each bed accommodating 50 nuts per row.
- 3. Irrigate the nursery beds once in three days.
- 4. Keep  the  nursery  free  of  weeds.  To  manage  the  weed  problem  in  coconut  nursery, growing sunnhemp 2 times (each harvested at flowering stage) followed by one hand weeding at 6 th month was found to be very effective besides yielding green manure for manuring the adult coconut palms.
- 5. Provide shade to the nursery by raising Sesbania or Leucaena on the sides of beds.
- 6. The seednuts start germination 6 - 8 weeks after planting and germination continues upto  six  months.  Select  seedlings  that  germinate  before  5  months  after  planting. Remove those nuts which do not germinate 5 months after sowing.
- 7. Regularly survey for pest and  diseases
- 8. Select seedlings 9 to 12 months after planting. Seedlings, which have germinated earlier, having good girth at collar and early splitting of leaflets, should be selected for planting. Do not select the so called Kakkamukku Pillai i.e., seednuts which have just germinated. Eliminate the seedlings which are deformed or having stunted growth.
- 9. Remove  the  seedlings  from  the  nursery  by  lifting  with  spade.  Do  not  pull  out  the seedlings by pulling leaves or stem.
- 10. Select quality seedlings with a minimum of 6 leaves and girth of 10 cm at collar.

## INTRODUCTION

Oil  palm  requires  evenly  distributed    annual  rainfall  of  2000  mm  without  a defined dry season.   In areas with dry spell, a deep soil with high water holding capacity and  a  shallow  water  table    augmented  with  copious  irrigation  will  satisfy  the  water requirement of the palm. Temperature  can be a limiting  factor  for oil palm production Best oil palm yields are  obtained in places  where a maximum  average  temperature  of 29-33 C and minimum  average  temperature  of 2-24 C are available.  Higher  diurnal temperature  variation  causes  floral  abortion  in regions  with a dry season.

The crop requires 1800-2000 sunlight hours annually, more than 300 cal/cm  / 2 per  day, constant sunlight of atleast 5 hours per day for better oil palm yield.

Moist, deep and well drained medium textured soils rich in humus  content  are considered ideal. Gravelly and sandy soils, particularly the coastal sands are not ideal for  oil  palm    cultivation.    Heavy  clay  soils  with  poor  drainage  properties  may  pose problems of aeration during rainy seasons.

## NURSERY AND ITS MANAGEMENT

Nursery is raised by planting  germinated  sprouts  initially  in a pre-nursery  bed or  in  polybags  in  a  primary  nursery  and  transplanting  them  at  five  leaf  stage  to  a secondary nursery of large sized polybags. Raising seedlings in large polybags without a pre-nursery stage is also being practiced.

The potting mixture is made by mixing top soil, sand and well decomposed cattle manure  in  equal  proportions.  Smaller  polybags  of  250  guage  and  23  x  13  cm  size, preferably black are used for raising primary nurseries. These bags are filled  with the potting  mixture  leaving  one cm at the top of the bag. A healthy germinated sprout is placed at the centre at 2.5 cm  depth.  While  placing  the  sprout, care must be taken to keep the plumule of the sprout facing upwards and  the  radicle  downwards in the soil. It  is  better  to  plant  sprouts  soon  after  the  differentiation of radicle and plumule. The seedlings are to be watered daily. Application of a fertilizer mixture containing one part of  ammonium sulphate, one part of super phosphate, one part of muriate of potash and two parts of magnesium sulphate  is recommended  at 15 g at one month stage, 45 g  at  three  months  stage  and  60    g  at  six  months  stage  per  seedling.  This  has  to  be applied 6 - 8 cm away from  seedlings  during  the  first application, 10-12 cm away during  second  and  15-20  cm  away  during  the  third  application    in  primary  nursery. Surface soil is slightly scratched at the time of fertilizer application.

## SINGLE STAGE POLY BAG NURSERY AND SECONDARY NURSERY

The germinated seeds can be directly planted into large black polybags with the advantage  of  avoiding  the  pre-nursery  stage.  At  present  the  single  stage  polybag nursery is recommended in India. Since the plants are to remain in these polybags  for more  than one year,  good  quality  polybags  of 500 gauge and 40 x 45 cm size are to be used. On the lower half of the bag, perforations are made at  an interval of 7.5 cm for drainage. A bag can carry 15 - 18 kg of nursery soil depending on the type of  soil mixture used.

The  water  requirement  for  different  stages  of  growth    of  seedlings    are  as follows:    0  -  2  months  at  4  mm/day,  2  -  4  months  at  5  mm/day,  4  -  6  months    at  7 mm/day  and 6 - 8 months  at 10 mm/day.  It is better to supply if feasible the daily requirement  in  two  halves  to  prevent  overflow    and    wastage  caused  by  one  time application. Application of 9 - 18 lit. of water per seedling per week  according  to  the stage of growth and soil  type.

## FIELD PLANTING

Prepare the land for oil palm plantings at least 3 months before transplanting the seedlings to the main field. In soils with low permeability, drainage channels are to be constructed to prevent water stagnation in upper layer of soil

## AGE OF SEEDLINGS AT TRANSPLANTING

It is advisable to plant well grown seedlings of 12 - 14 months old. At this stage, a well developed tenera seedling will have a height of 1-1.3 m from base and will have more  than  13 functional leaves. These seedlings were found to maintain  higher  leaf production,  bear  earlier, produce heavy bunches, give higher fruit/bunch ratio and a higher oil to mesocarp in the first year of harvest.

## SELECTION OF SEEDLINGS

All deformed, diseased and elongated seedlings are to be discarded. Differences  in  the  height of healthy seedlings ranging from 90 to 159 cm tend to even up  after  14  months  of  transplanting to maintain.

## TIME OF TRANSPLANTING

Transplanting to the main field has to be done during the onset of rainy season. In very impermeable soils and where there is chance for the seedlings to suffer severely during rainy season, proper drainage has to be ensured.

## SPACING AND METHOD OF PLANTING

The optimum planting density for oil palm is the density of population that gives maximum production from unit area. Triangular system of planting with 9 x 9 x 9 m spacing accommodates 143 palms/ha. is being recommended.  For efficient  utilization of solar energy  the rows  are to be  oriented in the North-South direction. Equilateral triangular system of planting with 9 m spacing between palms will allow each plant to occupy the centre of a hexagon thus allowing better use of the area.

## TRANSPORTING SEEDLINGS AND PREPARING PITS

While  transporting  seedlings  to  the  planting  site  one  hand  is  placed  at  the bottom of the bag while holding the plant collar with the other one. Leather gloves can be used  to avoid  injury  with  spines of the leaves.

Pits of 60 cm  are taken prior to planting and filled with surrounding top soil and 3 allowed to  settle. Rock phosphate is applied at 200 g per planting pit. Nitrogen is not usually  applied  in the  planting pits as the application of fertilizers may damage the root system and affect survival  of the  plants if there is a dry period soon after planting. Nitrogen and potassium are usually applied 4 - 6 weeks  after  planting.  In Mg deficient soils,  magnesium  is applied  at 100 g as anhydrous  MgSO4   or 200 g epsum salt per seedling.

## REPLACEMENT AND GAP FILLING

Field inspection is carried out one to two months after planting to gap fill  dead plants. Replanting is carried out during the onset of next monsoon. These  palms are to be given special  care so that they can catch up with the rest of the plantations. Early production of more  female  inflorescences in the initial 30 months, is an indication of high yielders and  all  those  that  fail  to produce female bunches will remain as poor yielders.  However, replacements  are  found  to  be  affected to some extent by the vigorous growth of the neighbouring palms which will  shade  the replanted palms.

## FERTILIZER REQUIREMENT

Based on the fertilizer experiments conducted under rainfed conditions in India, the following fertilizer schedule is recommended for oil palm until specific results are derived from multilocational fertilizer trials.

Age

|             | Nutrients (gram/palm/year)  N   | Nutrients (gram/palm/year)  N   | Nutrients (gram/palm/year)  N   |
|-------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
|             |                                 | P                               | K                               |
| First year  | 400                             | 200                             | 400                             |
| Second year | 800                             | 400                             | 800                             |
| Third year  | 1200                            | 600                             | 270                             |
| onwards     |                                 |                                 | 0                               |

## METHOD OF FERTILIZER APPLICATION

The fertilizers are preferably applied in two equal split doses during  May  -  June and September -October by uniformly spreading them within a 2 metre circle around the base of the palm and forking to incorporate  them into the soil. Supply of sufficient quantity  of green leaves or compost   is  advantageous  especially  where  the  soil  is poor in organic matter content. Mg  deficiency can be  corrected  through  the application of 500 g of MgSO4 palm/year.  Borax @ 100 g per palm also recommended.

Urea is found to be the most economic nitrogen source if losses by volatilization and leaching are minimised. Rock phosphate and muriate of potash are the best source

for phosphorus and potassium respectively. During the initial years fertilizers  may be applied  within  the area covered  by the crown canopy. In the case of older  palms, fertilizers  are applied  depending  on the  concentration of roots and are usually applied in  the  weeded  circle.  Appropriate  soil  conservation  methods  such  as  growing  cover crops  and  platform  cutting  (on  sloppy  lands)  enhance  the  efficiency  of  fertilizers  by preventing losses through run off.

## NUTRIENTS - FUNCTIONS AND DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS

The effect of major nutrients  on growth  and yield of oil palm has been studied in most of the  oil palm growing countries in Asia and Africa.

a) Nitrogen: In oil palm, characteristic yellowing symptoms are developed under N deficiency conditions. Nitrogen is found to be essential for rapid growth and fruiting of  the  palm.  It  increases    the  leaf  production  rate,  leaf  area,  net  assimilation  rate, number of bunches and bunch weight. Excessive application of nitrogen increases the production of male inflorescence and decreases female inflorescence thereby reducing the sex ratio.

b) Phosphorus: In oil  palm  seedlings,  P  deficiency  causes  the  older    leaves    to become  dull  and assume a pale olive green colour while in adult palms high incidence of premature desiccation of older leaves occurs. Phosphorus application increases the bunch production rate, bunch  weight,  number of female inflorescences and thereby the sex ratio. However, lack of response to P due to P fixation in soils is very common in the tropics. Eventhough the main effect of phosphorus on the productivity of the palm has not been significant in most studies, it gives a positive interaction with nitrogen and potassium.

c) Potassium: When potassium is deficient, growth as well as yield is retarded and it is translocated from mature leaves to growing points. Under severe deficiency, the  mature  leaves  become chlorotic and necrotic. Confluent orange spotting is the main  K deficiency  condition  in  oil palm in which chlorotic spots, changing from pale green through yellow to  orange,  develop  and  enlarge both between and across the leaflet,  veins  and  fuse  to  form  compound lesions of a  bright orange colour. Necrosis within spots is common, but irregular. Mid crown yellowing is  another  prominent K deficiency  condition  of  the  palm  in  which  leaves  around  the  10th    position    on    the phyllotaxy  become  pale  in  colour  followed  by  terminal    and  marginal    necrosis.    A narrow band  along  the midrib usually remains green. There  is a tendency  for later formed  leaves  to become  short and  the palm has an unthrifty appearance with much premature  withering.

Potassium removal is large compared to the normal exchangeable  K  content  in most  top soils. It is  mostly required for the production of more number of bunches, maximum  number  of  female  inflorescences,  increased  bunch  weight  and  also  for increasing the total dry matter  production  and yield.

d) Magnesium:  In  adult  oil  palm  and  in  seedlings  in  the  field,  severe  Mg deficiency symptoms are most striking and have been named as 'orange frond'. While the lower  most  leaves  are  dead, those above them show a gradation of colouring

from  bright  orange  on  the  lower  leaves  to  faint  yellow    on  leaves  of  young  and intermediate age. The youngest leaves do not show any discolouration. The most typical Mg-deficiency symptom is the shading  effect  in which  the shaded  portion  of the leaflet    will  be  dark  green  while  the  exposed  portion  of  the  same  leaflet  is  chlorotic. Heavy rates of K  applications induce Mg-deficiency, particularly on poor acid soils.

Among  the  secondary  nutrients,  calcium  and  sulphur,  and  probably  chlorine, may not pose  much problems to oilpalm cultivation in the country.

- e) Micronutrients: Micronutrient elements, iron, manganese, copper and  zinc are    not  generally  found  limiting  in  the  nutrition  of  oil  palm  on  acid  soil  conditions. Boron deficiency  is occasionally found on young palms in the field showing a reduction of leaf area in certain leaves producing incipient 'little leaf', advanced 'little leaf' with extreme  reduction  of leaf area and bunching  and reduction in the number of leaflets and 'fish-bone' leaf. The 'fish-bone' leaves are abnormally stiff with leaflets reduced to projections.  Leaf  malformations  including    'hook    leaf'    and  corrugated    leaflets  are some  other  associated  symptoms.  Soil  application  of  50  -  200  g  borax,  per  palm, depending  on  age, and severity of symptoms is practiced for correcting the malady.

## WATER REQUIREMENT

Continuous soil moisture availability encourages vigorous growth and increased yield of oil  palm. Adequate supply of water, good soil depth and water holding capacity contribute to water availability. In oil palm as water deficiency increases, stomata will remain  closed  and  the  development  and  opening  of  spear  will  be  inhibited.  Water deficiency adversely affects flower initiation, sex differentiation and therefore, results in low sex ratio due to production  of more  male  inflorescences.  It is established that oil palm needs 120 - 150 mm of water to meet  its  monthly  evapo-transpiration needs. In areas where perennial water source is available, basin irrigation is possible. But where the terrain is undulating and water is scarce during summer months, drip irrigation  is recommended  to  keep four drippers per palm in the weeded palm circle to supply atleast  90  litres  of  water  per  palm  per  day  during  summer  months  which  will  vary according to the ETP values in a locality.

## FERTIGATION

Drip fertigation with the recommended dose of fertilsers at bimonthly interval was found to increase the yield.

## WEED CONTROL

The basin area of oil palm is kept free of weed growth through ring weeding. It is  more important for young palms, roots of which are to be kept free from competition from  weed.  Depending on the extent of weed growth and rainfall, hand weeding is carried out even upto four times in a year during early years of the plantation which is progressively reduced to two rounds a year.

Herbicide application has become  common  in recent years. Care must be taken in the choice  of herbicide and its application to prevent the damage of young palms. It is    recommended    to    preferably  apply  contact  herbicides  rather  than  translocated herbicides. Translocated herbicides like Paraquat which is inactivated when contacted with soil are also used. Herbicides such as 2, 4-D, 2, 4- 5-T, halogenated aliphatic acids Dalapon and TCA are found to produce abnormalities in oil palm seedlings and are to be

avoided.  Pre-emrergence Atrazine @ 1.0 kg/ha for the control of grasses and sedges and POE Paraquat 10 ml / litre of water.

## MAINTENANCE OF PATHS

In young plantation, the maintenance of paths is important for inspection and in later years for harvesting. This is carried out by timely weed control as done in the case of ring weeding.

## ABLATION

The  bunches  produced  initially  will  be  very  small  and  have  low  oil  content. Removal  of  such  inflorescences  is called ablation or castration. Removal  of  all inflorescences during the initial  three  years is found to improve vegetative growth of young  palms  so  that  regular  harvesting  can  commence  after  three  and  half  years  of planting.  Ablation  is  done  at  monthly  interval  by  pulling  out  the  young  inflorescence using  gloves  or  with  the  help  of  devices  such  as  narrow  bladed    chisels.    Ablation improves drought resistance  capacity  of young palms by improving  shoot and root growth  especially  in low production areas where dry condition exists.

## PRUNING OF LEAVES

In oil palm two leaves are produced per month. Therefore, it becomes necessary to prune excess leaves so as to gain access to bunches for harvest. Severe pruning will adversely affect both growth and yield of palm, cause abortion of female flowers and also reduce the size of the leaves.  It  was suggested  that palms aged 4 - 7 years should retain 6 - 7 leaves  per spiral (48 - 56), those aged    8 - 14 years 5 - 6 leaves per spiral (40 - 49) and those above 15 years should have 4 - 5 leaves per  spiral (32 - 40). Leaf pruning is carried out in India using  chisels  so that leaf base  that is retained  on the palm is  as  short  as  possible  or  otherwise  it  may  catch  loose  fruits,    allow  growth    of epiphytes  and the leaf axils form a potential site for pathogens.  The leaf petioles  are removed  by giving a clear cut at a sufficient distance from the base of the petiole using a sharp chisel for young  palms  and with  the  long sickle in taller palms.

Pruning is preferably carried out at the end of the rainy season. It is also better  to carry  it out during the low crop season when labourers are also available. Pruning is confined to only lower senile leaves during initial harvests but when canopy closes in later years, leaves are cut so as to retain two whorls of fronds below the ripe  bunch.

## Insect pollination in oil palm

The oil palm, hitherto though to be wind pollinated, has been now proved to be an a insect pollinated species. From West Africa, the original home of oil  palm,  eight species  of  pollinating weevils were reported. Occurence of Eldeidobius kamerunicus in the  oil  palm  plantations  of  Kerala  was  introduced  during  1985  from  where  it  was introduced and got  established  in  little  Andamans during 1986.

The weevils are dark brown in colour. Adult weevils feed on the anther filament. Eggs are deposited inside the male flowers and larva feeds on the spent flowers. Lifecycle  is completed  within 11 to 13 days. Males live longer than females. The activity of the insects is in accordance with the receptivity of the male and female inflorescences.

It was roughly estimated that 40 palms in a grove might be the minimum to sustain  a sufficiently  high  continuous  population  of pollinators  to pollinate. All are receptive female  inflorescences.  The  weevils  carry  maximum  pollen  during  the  third  day  of antheses.  Antennae,  rostrum,  thorax,  legs  etc.  are  the  main  sites  of  pollen  land. E.kamerunicushas a fairly good searching ability. It can survive in dry as well as in wet seasons.

Introduction of weevil in India increased the fruit let from 36.8  percent  to  56.1 percent  resulting  in  40  per  cent  increase  in  F/B  ratio.  The  maximum  attainable pollination  potential  was  as much as to cent percent with 57 percent increase in FFB weight.

For  introduction,  male  flowers  cut  from  palms  which  have  the  weevils  are transferred to a plantation where one wishes to introduce. In order to make sure that they are not carrying any plant pathogens to other area/countries, we have to breed them under laboratory conditions  for seven  or eight generations before introduction.

## Pest Management

In India,  since  the  import  of  germplasm  is  in  the  form  of    seeds/sprouts, possibilities    for  introduction  of  the  pest  species  from  other  countries  are  limited.  But many of the pest species of related palm species such as coconut and areca  palm, have got adapted  to oil palm.  Among  the 49 species  of insects infesting adult oilpalms, 14 species  are  known  pests  of  coconut  and  19  species  are  known  pests  of  areca  palms. Insect pests of oilpalm in India are more or less same as those reported from Malaysia and other South-East Asian countries.

## PEST OF ADULT PALMS

## The rhinoceros beetle

The rhinoceros beetle is primarily a serious pest of coconut palm, and in recent years has attained the pest status in oilpalm also. The adult beetle which bores through into the spear leaves, resulting in snapping of the fronds at the feeding sites. In oil palm plantations  failed  female  inflorescences,  dead  palm  trunks,  persistent    leaf  axils  and empty bunch heaps, act as breeding  sites  for the pest.

## The red palm weevil

Infestation by the red palm weevil Chynchophorus ferrungineus was noticed in majority of oil palm plantations resulting in the death of the palms. Damage  is due  to the feeding  activity  of the  grubs, usually 12-87 per palm, which bore through and feed on the softer  tissues  of    stem    and    meristem.  Palms  infested  by  R.ferrugineus  show gradual wilting and drying of outer whorl of fronds. In some cases roofing of spear was also noticed.

## Biological control

In  nature,  the  rhinoceros  beetle  is  suppressed    by    entomophogens    like Baculovirus  oryctusvirus and Metarhizium  anisopliae . Release  of Baculovirusoryctes minimise the pest incidence.

## Cultural control

- i) Field  sanitation  and  elimination  of  breeding  sites  like  dead  palm  trunks,  empty bunch heaps etc., within the plantations are essential for the management of both red palm weevil and rhinoceros beetle.
- ii) When  the  infestation  by  rhinoceros  beetle  is  very  high,  especially  in    young plantations,  Hand picking of the adult beetles using hooks is very effective.
- iii) For red palm weevils, use of attractants incorporating fermented sugarcane juice, acetic  acid,  yeast etc., to collect and kill the adult weevils is recommended.

## Chemical control

- i) For rhinoceros beetles, placing 3-4 napthalene balls in the youngest spear axils at weekly intervals is recommended.
- ii) For palms with advanced stage of infestation by red palm weevil, stem injection of 5-8 ml of monocrotophos is advised.

## Fruit bunch covering against avian pests

Covering the bunches with different materials such as  noirenets,  reed  baskets, plaited coconut leaf baskets  and senile  oil palm leaf are effective  in preventing  the fruit damage.  But senile  oil palm leaf covering is more practical and economical as the material  is  readily  available  and  involves only the labour charges  and cost of rope bits.

## Rodent control

Among rats, the burrowing type is more serious which tunnel into the bole of the  seedlings.  Different  baits  such  as  acute  poison  baits  (Zinc  phosphide,  Aluminium phosphide etc.) anticoagulants (warfarin, fumarin, bromadiolone) and traps such as iron like  traps,    snap    traps,    deathfall    trap,    boro  trap  etc.  may  be  used  as  an  integrated approach to minimise the rodent damage to the crop.

## Disease

Oil palm, a new crop to the country is reported to be affected by a number of diseases and disorders. Among these, bud rot causes considerable economic losses.

## Bud rot

- · Higher disease incidence is noticed  in young plantations.  Rotting initiates at the basal portion  of the spear closure to the meristem and extends to the whole spear. The spear  could  be  easily pulled off.
- · Cleaning the affected tissues and drenching the crown  with  carbendazim  0.1 percent  cures the disease.
- · The leaves emerging immediately after the application of fungicides are shorter and successively emerging ones are normal.

## Leaf spots

- · Leaf spots caused by Curvularia noticed on the inner whirl and  young  leaves. The  fungal spots enlarge with a yellow ring around spots. As these spots enlarge the  leaf  will  be  scorched.
- · Pestalotiopsis fungal  spots  are  irregular  with  grey  to  brown  centre.  Numerous black dots, the acervuli of the fungus, are seen on the lesions.

## Management

Affected leaves must be cut and burnt Spray Mancozeb @ 0.2%.

## HARVESTING

Proper and timely harvesting of fruit bunches is an important operation which determines  the  quality  of  oil  to  a  great  extent.  The  yield  is  expressed  as  fresh    fruit bunches  (FFB)  in kg per hectare  per year or as oil per hectare per year. The bunches usually  ripen  in  six  months  after  anthesis.  Unripe  fruits  contain  high  water  and carbohydrate and very little oil. As the fruit ripens  oil content  increase  to 80 - 85% in mesocarp.  Over  ripe  fruit  contains  more  free  fatty  acids  (FFA)  due  to  decomposition and thus increases the acidity. Usually the ripe fruits, attached  to the bunches  contain 0.2 to 0.9%  FFA  and when it comes out of extraction plant the FFA content is above 3%.Ripeness of the fruit is determined by the degree of detachment of the fruit from bunches,  change  in  colour  and  change  in  texture  of  the  fruit.  Ripening  of  fruits  start from  top  downwards,    nigrescens    fruits    turning    reddish  orange  and  the  virescens (green) to reddish brown. Fruits also get detached from tip downward in 11 - 20 days time. Ripeness is faster in young palms than in older palms for the bunches of equal weight.  The  criteria  used  in  determining  the  degree  of  ripeness  based  on  the  fruit detachment are as follows:

- a) fallen fruits: 10 detached or easily removable fruits for young palms and 5 for adult palms,
- c) quantity of detachment per bunch; fruit detachment on 25% of visible surface of bunch.
- b) number of fruits detached after the bunch is cut; 5 or more fruits/kg of bunch weight,

These criteria could be applied with flexibility.

## FREQUENCY OF HARVESTING

Harvesting  rounds  should  be  made  as  frequent  as  possible    to  avoid  over ripening    of  bunches.  A  bunch  which  is  almost  ripe  but  not  ready  for  harvest  for  a particular  harvesting  round  should  not  be  over-ripe  by  next  round.  In  lean  period  of production, harvesting can be made less frequent and  it  should be more frequent in peak periods. Harvesting rounds of 7 - 14 days are generally  practiced. Other factors determining  frequency  are,  extraction  capacity  of  the  mill,  transportation  facilities, labour availability and skill of the workers. In India, harvesting is usually carried out with a chisel of 6 - 9 cm wide attached to a wooden pole or light hollow  aluminium  pipe, Bunches    are  cut    without    damaging  the  petiole    the  leaf  that  supports    it.  Use  of narrow  chisel    is  usually    carried    out  till  the  palm  reaches    two  meters  above  the ground.  For  taller  palms  upto  4  meters,  a  wider  chisel  of  14  cm  is  used.  The curved knife is attached to a long bamboo or aluminium  pole with screws  or steel wires to harvest  from taller palms. In uneven stands, an adjustable, telescopic type of pole is in use.

## Yield of Oilpalm

In well maintained garden the yield of oilpalm will be as furnished below :

| Age of oilpalm   |   Yield Ton/ha/year |
|------------------|---------------------|
| 3-4 years        |                   5 |
| 4-5 years        |                  12 |
| 5-6 years        |                  25 |
| 6-25 years       |                  30 |

## ECONOMICS

A  detailed  account  of  the  economics  of  oilpalm  cultivation  in  India  has  been furnished. The data furnished therein is modified using current labour charges and oil price  and  the  details  on  various  investments  and  returns  from  one  hectare  adult plantation.  This  excludes  the    cost    of    land    as    we  expect  government  owned  land, leased land, or already owned property will be used for oilpalm cultivation. From the fourth year, the yield of bunches increases upto tenth year, and  a  stabilized bearing is attained thereafter. The investment during first year under  irrigation  will be almost three  times  of  that  under  rainfed  conditions  mainly    on  account    of  the  initial expenditure  required  to install the drip irrigation system. With irrigation the annual returns will  exceed the annual expenses  from the first harvest itself, i.e, during  the fourth  year after planting.  By the end of sixth year the total  returns  will be more than total  investments  including  all  the  expenditure  for  installing  pumpset  and  the  drip irrigation  system.  A minimum  of 22 FFB per hectare  can be expected  from the tenth year onwards.

## Definition/terminologies

## Staple length

Graders estimate the fibre length by hand stapling and is called staple length and expressed in millimeter.

## Microniare

It is the measure of the index of the fibre diameter and is assessed by determining weight per unit length of the fibre. It is expressed in micronaire value (µg/inch).

## Fibre strength

Fibre strength is generally considered to be next to fibre length and fineness.  It is referred as bundle or tensile strength, essential for high speed spinning. It determines yarn strength. Unit of this parameter was expressed in gms/tex.

## Uniformity ratio

It is the ratio of 50% span length to 2.5% span length expressed as percentage.

50% span length x 100

Uniformity ratio =

2.5% span length

## Maturity - Coefficient:

The maturity of cotton fibres is expressed by the maturity ratio parameter, which is calculated on the basis of the fibre circularity coefficient , defined as the ratio of the cell wall area and that of a circle of the same perimeter as the fibre cross-section.

## CROP MANAGEMENT

## I. PREPARATION OF FIELD FOR IRRIGATED COTTON CROP FIELD PREPARATION

## 1.1.1 PREPARATION OF THE FIELD

- i) Prepare the field to get a fine  tilth.
- ii) Chiselling for soils with hard pan: Chisel the soils having hard pan formation at shallow depths with chisel plough at 0.5 M interval, first in one direction and then in the direction perpendicular to the previous one, once in three years. Apply 12.5 t farm yard manure or composted coir pith/ha besides chiselling to get increased yield
- iii) If intercropping of Greengram/Soyabean is proposed, prepare the main field, so as  to  provide  ridges  and  furrows  to  take  up  sowing  20  days  prior  to  cotton sowing.

## 1.1.2. APPLICATION OF FYM/COMPOST AND BIOFERTILIZERS

Spread 12.5 t of FYM or compost or 2.5 t of vermicompost per ha if available, uniformly on the unploughed soil.

Apply 2 kg of Azospirillum + 2 kg Phosphobacteria (or) 2 kg of Azophos + 2 kg Pink Pigmented Facultative Methylotroph (PPFM) with 25 kg of FYM and 25 kg of sand, mix uniformly before sowing as soil application.

## 1.1.3. PRE-TREATMENT OF ACID DELINTED SEEDS WITH BIOFERTILIZER

Treat one hectare of seeds with 600g of Azospirillum, 600g of Phosphobacteria (or) 600 g of Azophos + 600 g of Silicate Solubilizing Bacteria.

Liquid formulation Treat one hectare of seeds with 125 ml of Azospirillum, 125 ml of  Phosphobacteria and Silicate  solubilizing  bacteria  (SSB)  shade  dry  for  30 minutes before sowing.

## 1.1.4. FORMATION OF RIDGES AND FURROWS

- i) Form ridges and furrows 10 m long with appropriate spacing depending upon the variety.
- ii) Use ridge plough or bund former to form ridges so as to economise on cost of cultivation.
- iii) In fields with ragi stubbles, just dibble cotton seeds at the specified spacings.
- iv) Adopt the following spacing between ridges for different  varieties/hybrids.

## Varieties/Hybrids Spacing between ridges (cm)

MCU 5, SVPR 2, LRA 5166, MCU 12, MCU 75

13

Suvin

90

MCU 7

60

NOTE: Adopt higher spacing rows in fertile soils by 15 to 30 cm.

## 1.1.5. APPLICATION OF INORGANIC FERTILIZERS

- v) If soil test recommendations are not available, follow the blanket recommendation for the different varieties.

## 1.2.3.ACID-DELINTING OF COTTON SEEDS

- i) Choose plastic bucket bucket for acid delinting of seeds.
- ii) Do not use earthen wares, metal vessels, porcelain wares or wooden drum for acid delinting as concentrated sulphuric acid will corrode them.
- iii) Put  the  required  quantity  of  seeds  in  the  container  and  add  commercial concentrated sulphuric acid at the rate of 100 ml per kg of fuzzy seed.
- iv) Stir vigorously and continuously with a wooden stick for 2 to 3 minutes till the fuzz sticking to the seeds is completely digested and the seed coat attains a dark brown colour of coffee powder.
- v) Add water to fill the container. Drain the acid water and repeat the washing 4 or 5 times to remove any trace of acid.
- vi) Remove  the  floating,  ill-filled  and  damaged  seeds  while  retaining  the  healthy and good seeds which remain at the bottom.
- vii) Drain the water completely and dry the delinted seeds in  shade.

## Advantages of Acid delinting

- i) Eliminates some externally seed borne pathogenic organisms.
- ii) Kills eggs, larvae and pupae of pink boll worm.
- iii) Helps to remove immature, ill-filled, cut and damaged  seeds.
- iv) Makes seed dressing more effective and  easy
- v) Facilitates  easy sowing and good germination.

## 1.2.4.1.PRE-TREATMENT OF ACID DELINTED SEEDS WITH FUNGICIDES

- i) Treat the delinted seeds with talc formulation of Trichoderma viride @ 4g/kg of
- seed or with Carbendazim (or) Thiram @ 2g/kg of seed. Biocontrol agents are compatible  with biofertilizers. First treat the seeds  with  biocontrol  agents  and  then  with  biofertilizers. Fungicides and biocontrol agents are incompatible.
- ii) Treat the delinted fungicide treated seeds with 3 packets (600 g) of Azospirillum and  3 packets of phosphobacteria 600g (or) 6 packets of Azophos  (1200 g) and sow immediately.

## 1.2.4.2.SEED HARDENING

Soak the seeds in equal volume of Pungam leaf extract (1%) for 8 hours and dry back to  original moisture to increase germination and vigour. Dry the seeds in shade.

Seed pelleting: Seeds coated with arappu leaf powder (100 g/kg) along with DAP (40 g/kg), micronutrient mixture (15 g/kg) and Azospirillum (200 g/kg) phosphobacteria (200 g/ha)  or Azophos  (400 g/ha) using 5% maida solution or gruel as adhesive (300 ml/kg) to increase the germination and vigour.

## 1.2.5.SOWING

- i) Dibble the seeds at a depth of 3-5 cm on the side of the ridge 2/3 height  from the  top  and    above  the  band  where  fertilisers  and  insecticides  are  applied, maintaining the correct spacing and then cover seeds with  soil.
- ii) In  the  case  of  intercropping,  sow  the  seeds  of  the  intercrop  in  between  the paired rows of cotton in a row of 5 cm apart and cover the seeds.
- iii) Sow the required number of seeds in each hole.

|                     | No. of seeds / hole   | No. of seeds / hole   |
|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Varieties / hybrids | Fuzzy seeds           | Delinted seeds        |
| Hybrids             | 2                     | 1                     |
| Varieties           | 3                     | 2                     |

## 1.2.6. WEED MANAGEMENT

- i) Apply Pendimethalin @ 1.0 litre/ha three days after sowing  or  Fluchloralin  1.0 kg  a.i  /ha  on    3DAS  +  power  weeding  on  45  DAS  followed  by  earthing  up  or Trifloxy salfuron @ 10 g/ha on 15 DAS for broad leave weeds and sedges.  Or Pre emergence application of Pendimathalin (38.7% CS) 650 ml/ha.              Sufficient moisture  should be present in the soil at the time of herbicide application. This will ensure weed free condition upto 40 days.
- ii) One hand weeding on 45 DAS will keep weed free environment upto 60 DAS.
- iii) Hoe and hand weed between 18th to 20th day of sowing, if herbicide  is not applied  at the  time of sowing.

## 1.2.7.GAP FILLING

- a. Take up gap filling on the 10th day of sowing.
- i) In the case of TCHB 213, raise seedlings in polythene bags of size 15 x 10 cm.
- ii) Fill the polythene bags with a mixture of FYM and soil in the ratio of 1:3.
- iii) Dibble one seed per bag on the same day when sowing is taken up in the field.
- iv) Pot water and maintain.
- v) On the 10th day of sowing, plant seedlings maintained in the polythene bags, one  in  each  of  the  gaps  in  the  field  by  cutting  open  the  polythene  bag  and planting the seedling along with  the soil intact and then pot  water.

b. In the case of all other varieties, dibble 3 to 4 seeds in each gap and pot water.

## 1.2.8.THINNING

Thin  out  the  seedlings  on  the  15th  day  of  sowing.  In  the  case  of  fertile  soils,

allow only one seedling per hole, whereas in poor soil allow two seedlings per hole.

## 1.2.9.TOP DRESSING

- iv) Top  dress  50%  of  the  recommended  dose  of  N  and  K  on  40  -  45  DAS  for varieties.
- v) Top dress 1/3rd of recommended dose of N on 40-45 DAS and the remaining 1/3rd on 60- 65 th DAS for hybrids.

## 1.2.10.RECTIFICATION OF RIDGES AND FURROWS

Reform  the  ridges  and  furrows  after  first  top  dressing  in  such  a  way  that  the plants are on the  top of the ridges and well supported by soil.

## 1.2.11.SPRAYING OF NAPTHALENE ACETIC ACID (NAA)

Spray 40 ppm NAA at 60 and 90 days after sowing on the crop to prevent early shedding of buds and squares and to increase the yield.

NOTE: 40 mg of NAA dissolved in one litre of water will give 40 ppm.

## 1.2.12.MANAGEMENT  STRATEGIES  FOR  DELAYED  SUMMER  IRRIGATED  COTTON SOWING

KCI  1%  spray,  twice  on  50  and  70  DAS  for  delayed  sowing  (first    fortnight    of March)    of    summer  irrigated  cotton  in  rice-cotton  cropping  system  for  Srivilliputhur region.

## 1.2.13.ARRESTING TERMINAL GROWTH

Nip the terminal portion of the main stem as indicated below:

For varieties having less than 160 days duration nip the terminal portion of the main stem beyond the 15th node (75 to 80 DAS) and for varieties and hybrids having more  than  160  days  duration beyond the 20th node (85 - 90 DAS).

The features of the methods are furnished below:

## Skip furrow irrigation

- a) Suited to heavy soils like clay and loam
- b) Alternate furrows should be skipped and may be converted to ridges having a wide bed formation.
- c) Short  term  crops  like  pulses  may  be  raised  in  wider  bed  without  exclusive irrigation.
- d) Water saving is 50% when compared to control.

## Alternate furrow irrigation

- a) During any one run of irrigation a particular set of alternate furrows is irrigated.
- b) The interval of irrigation should be shortened when  compared  to  the conventional furrows.
- c) During the next run, the left over furrows be irrigated.
- d) Suited to heavy soils like clay and loam.

## III. HARVESTING

- a) Harvest at frequent intervals, at less than 7 days interval.
- b) Harvest in the morning hours upto 10 to 11 a.m only when there is moisture  so that  dry    leaves  and  bracts  do  not  stick  to  the  kapas  and  lower  the  market value.
- c) Pick kapas from well burst bolls only.
- d) Remove only the kapas from the bolls and leave the bracts on the plants.
- e) After kapas is picked, sort out good puffy ones and keep separately.
- f) Keep stained, discoloured and insect attacked kapas  separately.
- NOTE: Do not mix stained, discoloured and insect damaged kapas with good kapas, as they will spoil the good kapas also and lower the market value of the produce.

## IV. POST HARVEST OPERATIONS

- 1) Immediately after picking, dry the kapas in shade. If it is not dried immediately the colour will change which will lower the market value.
- 2) Do not dry the kapas under  direct sun as the fibre strength  and luster  will be lost.
- 3) Grade the kapas into good and second quality ones, if it is not sorted out at the time of picking.
- 4) Spread a thin layer of dry sand on the ground and keep the kapas over it.

## RICE FALLOW COTTON

## 2.1.PREPARATION OF THE FIELD

- i) If  the  soil  is  in  waxy  condition,  instead  of  Zero  tillage,  the  seed  rows  may  be tilled and the seed dibbled in Virudhunagar  district.
- ii) If the soil is dry and not in condition to take up sowing, let in water and then allow the soil to dry till soil comes to waxy  condition.
- iii) At the lower level of the field dig a trench 15 cm wide and connect this trench to the outside channel to drain off the excess  water.

## 2.2.PRE-TREATMENT OF ACID DELINTED SEEDS WITH FUNGICIDES

- iv) Same as for the irrigated  crop.
- v) Treat the acid delinted and fungicide treated seeds with 3 packets  (600g)  of Azospirillum  and sow immediately.

* In fertile soils

## 2.4.FILLING UP GAPS

- vi) Fill up gaps on the 10th day of  sowing.
- vii) Dibble 2 to 3 acid delinted seeds or 4 to 5 fuzzy seeds in the gaps in the case of MCU 7 and SVPR 3

## 2.5.THINNING SEEDLINGS

- viii) Thin out seedlings on the 20th day of sowing
- ix) Leave only one healthy and vigorous seedling per hill.

## 2.6. WEED MANAGEMENT

- i) Pre-emergence  application  of  Pendimethalin  1.0  litre/ha  ensures  weed  free condition for 40 - 45 days.  This  should  be followed  by one hand  weeding  and earthing up during 40 - 45 days.
- ii) Take up hoeing and weeding 20 days after sowing.
- iii) Take  up  this  operation  when  the  top  soil  dries  up  and  comes  to  proper condition.

## 2.7.APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS

- a) Apply NPK fertilisers as per soil test recommendations. If soil test is not done follow the blanket recommendation of 60:30:30 kg NPK/ha.
- b) Apply half the dose of N and K full dose of P5O5 at 35th day in old delta and balance in 55 days the rows of cotton plants. In the case New delta apply full P and 1/3 of N and K at 20 DAS and 2/3 N and K at 40  DAS.

## 2.8.APPLICATION OF MICRONUTRIENTS

Apply  basally12.5  kg/ha  micronutrient  mixture  prepared  by  Department  of Agriculture. Apply MgSo4 basally @ 30 kg/ha to prevent reddening.

## 2.9.FORMATION OF RIDGES Old delta

- a) If soil  is  in  condition,  give  a  hoeing  with  mammutti  and  form  ridges  and incorporate the  fertilizer  in the  soil  around  the  plants  between  30th  to  35th day of sowing.
- b) If soil is not in condition, give one hoeing and weeding and cover the fertilizers.
- c) Form long ridges and furrows from one end of the field to the other without forming any separate channels for carrying water to prevent excessive soaking of water.
- d) Form ridges  and  furrows  on  alternate  rows  of  plants.  Skip  furrow  method  of irrigation to prevent excessive  irrigation

## New delta

- a) Give a hoeing with mummutti and form ridges and incorporate the fertiliser in the soil around the plants on the 40th day of  sowing.
- b) If soil is not in condition give one hoeing and weeding and cover the fertilizers.
- c) Form long ridges  &amp; furrows  on alternate  rows  of plants  to adopt  skip  furrow irrigation.

- xi) In  the  case  of  cotton,  intercropped  with  pulses,  one  paired  row  of  cotton  is alternated with two rows of pulses and the total population  of cotton  crop is maintained  at the same  line as that  for a pure crop of cotton.
- xii) Adopt a spacing of 30 x 10 cm for the pulse crop in between each paired  row of cotton.  APK  1 Blackgram is best suited for this situation.

## 3.2.7.ACID DELINTING

Adopt procedure for acid delinting as for an irrigated crop.

## 3.2.8.PRETREATMENT OF ACID DELINTED SEEDS WITH FUNGICIDES

Same as for the irrigated crop.

## 3.2.9.SOWING

xiii) Use the multipurpose farming implement to sow the seeds and to apply basal fertilizers simultaneously.

- xiv) Fill  the  hopper  in  the  implement  with  the  fertilizer  mixtures  and  work  the implement.
- xv) Engage 3 persons for dropping the seeds, 2 for cotton and one for pulses.
- In  one  operation,  placement    of  fertilizer,  sowing  of  seeds  and  covering    will  be completed.

NOTE:  Cotton  and pulses can be sown at a depth of 5 cm in black cotton soil even before  the onset    of monsoon rains in dry bed sowing. When light rains are received, the moisture will not penetrate deeper and the seeds will not germinate and  die  away.  Only  when  good  rains  are  received,  the  moisture  level  will  be sufficient  to  penetrate  to  the  level  of  the  seed  and  facilitate  germination  and proper establishment.

## 3.2.10. WEED MANAGEMENT

- xvi) Pre-emergence application of Pendimethalin (38.7% CS) 650 ml/ha followed by one hand weeding on 40 days after crop emergence. At the time of herbicide application sufficient  soil moisture  must be there.

xvii) If sufficient soil moisture is not available for applying herbicides hand weeding may be given at 10 - 20 days after crop  emergence.

xviii) Integrated  weed  management  in  cotton:  Post  emergence  application  of pyrithiobac sodium @ 62.5g a.i./ha + quizalofop ethyl @ 50 g a.i./ha at 2 to 4 leaf stage or 45 DAS.

## 3.2.11. GAP FILLING

Dibble 3 to 4 seeds in each gap if sufficient moisture is available.

## 3.2.12. THINNING SEEDLINGS

- xix) Allow  two  seedlings  per  hole  and  thin  out  on  15th  day  of  sowing,  adopting proper spacing between plants.
- xx) Thin the pulse crop on the 20th day of sowing, adopting a spacing of 15 cm between plants for cowpea and 10 cm for other pulse crop.

## 3.2.13. FOLIAR FERTILIZATION

Spray 0.5% urea and 1% KCl on the 45th and 65th day of sowing if sufficient moisture is available.

## In site water harvesting and crop resident addition for rainfed cotton in black soil.

Brand  Bed  Furrow  (BBF)  system  wth  coirpith  application  @  5  t/ha  for  higher  soil moisture retension, seed cotton yield and enhanced the carbon storage under vermisols.

## 3.2.14. INTERCULTIVATION WITH DHANTHULU/BLADE HARROW

Work dhanthulu or blade harrow on the 30th and 45th day of sowing.

NOTE: Other cultivation practices, plant protection measures, harvest etc., are the same as for the irrigated crop.

## CROP PHYSIOLOGY

Foliar spray of TNAU Cotton Plus @ 2.5 kg/acre in 200 litres of water at flowering and  at  boll  formation  stages  reduces  flower  and  square  shedding,  improves  boll bursting, increases seed cotton yield and imparts drought  tolerance.

## CROP PROTECTION

## B. PEST MANAGEMENT

- · Remove the cotton crop and dispose off the crop residues as soon as harvest is over.
- · Avoid stacking of stalks in the field.
- · Avoid ratoon and double cotton crop.
- · Adopt proper crop rotation.
- · Use optimum irrigation and fertilizers.
- · Grow one variety throughout the village as far as possible.
- · Treat the seeds with imidacloprid or use designer seed (Delinted seed + polykote @ 3g  /  kg  +  carbendazim  @  2  g  /  kg  +  imidacloprid  @  7  g  /  kg  + Pseudomonas fluorescens 10  g  /  kg  +  Azophos  40  g  /  kg).  When  the  treated  seeds  are  used,  it protects against sucking pests upto 45 days after sowing and promotes early vigour of the crop.
- · Synchronize the sowing time in the villages and complete the sowing within 10 to 15 days.
- · Avoid other malvaceous crops in the vicinity of cotton crop.
- · Timely earthing up and other agronomic practices should be done.
- · Hand  pick  and  burn  periodically  egg  masses,  visible  larvae,  affected  and  dropped squares, flowers and fruits and squash pink bollworm in the rosettes.

- · Use locally fabricated light traps (modified Robinson type) with 125W mercury lamps to determine the prevalence and insect population fluctuations.
- · The  magnitude  of  the  activity  of  the  moths  of  the  cotton  pink  bollworm,  the  cut worm ( Spodoptera litura ) and the American bollworm can be assessed by setting up the species-specific sex pheromone trap each at the rate of 12 per ha.
- · Apply  insecticides  only  where  it  is  absolutely  necessary  when  pest  population  or damage reaches ET level.
- · Intercropping with pulses viz., cowpea, greengram, blackgram, soybean and maize reduces    the  bollworm  incidence  and  population  of  sucking  pests  of  cotton, viz ., aphid and leafhopper with the highest activity of natural enemies viz .,  spiders and predatory lady bird beetles.

## American bollworm

## Monitoring:

Helicoverpa armigera

Pest  monitoring  through  light  traps,  pheromone  traps  and in situ assessments  by  roving  and  fixed  plot  surveys  has  to  be intensified at farm, village, block, regional and State levels. For management,  an  action  threshold  of  one  egg  per  plant  or  1 larva per plant may be adopted.

## Cultural practices:

- · Synchronized sowing of cotton preferably with short duration varieties in each cotton ecosystem.
- · Avoid continuous cropping of cotton both during winter and summer seasons in the same area as well as rationing.
- · Avoid  monocropping.  Growing  of  less  preferred  crops  like greengram, blackgram, soyabean, castor, sorghum etc. , along  with the cotton  as intercrop or border  crop  or alternate crop to reduce the pest infestation.
- · Removal and destruction of crop residues to avoid carry over of the pest to the next season, and avoiding extended period of crop growth by continuous irrigation.

- · Optimizing the use of nitrogenous fertilizers which will not favour the multiplication of the pest.
- · Judicious water management for the  crop to prevent excessive vegetative growth and larval harbourage.

## Biological control:

- · Application of Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (NPV) at       3 x 10 12 POB / ha in evening hours at 7 th and  12 th week after sowing.
- · Conservation  and  augmentation  of  natural  predators  and parasitoids for effective control of the pest.
- · Inundative release of egg parasitoid, Trichogramma spp., at 6.25 cc / ha at 15 days interval 3 times from 45 days after sowing
- · Egg- larval parasitoid, Chelonus blackburnii and predator, Chrysoperla carnea at 1,00,000 / ha at 6 th , 13 th and 14 th week after sowing.
- · ULV spray of NPV at 3 x 10 12  POB / ha with 10% cotton seed kernel  extract,  10%  crude  sugar,  0.1%  each  of  Tinopal  and Teepol for effective control of Helicoverpa .

Note: Dicofol, methyl demeton and monocrotophos are comparatively  safer  to Chrysoperla larva  recording  low  egg mortality.

## Chemical control :

- · Discourage the indiscriminate use of insecticides, particularly synthetic pyrethroids.
- · Use of proper insecticides which are comparatively safer to natural enemies  at  the  correct dosage  and  alternating different groups of insecticides for each round of spray.
- · Avoid combination of insecticides as tank mix.
- · Adopt proper delivery system using spraying equipments like hand compression sprayer, knapsack sprayer and mist blower to ensure proper coverage with required quantity of spray fluid and avoid ULV applications or  Akela spray applications.
- · Proper mixing and preparation of spray fluid for each filling of spray fluid tank.

## COTTON - VARIETAL SEED PRODUCTION

## Land requirement

- · Land should be free of volunteer plants and designated diseases especially the wilt disease. The previous crop should not be of the same variety or other varieties of the same  crop.  It  can  be  the  same  variety  if  it  is  certified  as  per  the  procedures  of certification agency.

## Isolation

- · Leave a distance of 50 m for foundation seeds and 30 m for certified seeds all around the field from the same and other varieties / hybrids of the crop.

## Season

• Summer crop : February - March

• Winter crop : August - September

## Acid delinting of fuzzy seeds

- · Delint  the  fuzzy  seeds  with  commercial  sulphuric  acid  @  100  ml  /  kg  of  seed  for 2 -  5  minutes depending upon the variety (2 minutes for MCU 5 and 5 minutes for MCU 12).
- · After acid delinting remove the floaters and insect damaged seeds and separate the brown colour and well filled sinkers.
- · Wash the collected seeds thoroughly for 3 to 4 times with fresh water and neutralize with 0.5 % lime solution for removal of traces of acid.

## Pre-sowing seed treatment

- · Seed hardening with 2 % KCl for 10 hrs in the seed to solution ratio 1:1 and dry back to original moisture content.
- · Seed coating with polymer @ 3 g / kg + imidachloprid @ 2 ml / kg + Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 g / kg + Azophos @ 120 g / kg of seed.
- · The above two treatments can be integrated as designer seed treatment.

## Foliar application

- · Spray 1 % Diammonium phosphate on 70th, 80th and 90th days after sowing.

## Roguing

- · The crop should be rogued for off-types from vegetative stage to harvesting stage based on plant stature, leaf size, leaf colour, stem colour, flower colour, petal spot, pollen colour, number of sympodia, boll size and shape to maintain genetic purity.

## Harvesting

- · Pick the fully bursted kapas periodically in six pickings at weekly intervals.
- · Consider first five pickings in winter crop and first four pickings in the summer crop for seed purpose, the seed from the subsequent pickings are inferior in quality.
- · Do not retain the kapas unpicked in the field for more than a week as it reduces seed quality.

## Pre-storage seed treatment

- · Treat the seeds with carbendazim @ 2 g / kg of seed.
- · Treat the seeds with halogen mixture (CaOCl2 + CaCO3 + arappu ( Albizzia amara ) leaf powder mixed in the ratio of 5:4:1 @ 3 g / kg of seed as eco-friendly treatment.

## Storage

- · Store the seeds in gunny or cloth bags for short term storage (8 - 9 months) with a seed moisture content of 8 - 10 %.
- · Store the seeds in polylined gunny bag for medium term storage (12 - 15 months) with a seed moisture content of 7 - 8 %.
- · Store  the  seeds  in  700  gauge  polythene  bag  for  long  term  storage  (more  than 15 months) with a seed moisture content less than 6 %.

## COTTON - HYBRID SEED PRODUCTION

## Land requirement

- · Land should be free from volunteer plants. The previous crop should not be the same variety or other varieties of the same crop. It can be the same variety if it is certified as per the procedures of certification agency.

## Isolation

- · For certified / quality seed production, leave a distance of 30 m all around the field from the same and other varieties / hybrids of cotton.
- · Between the parental lines leave an isolation distance of 5 m.

## Seeds and sowing

• Male

: 2 kg / ha

• Female

: 4 kg / ha

## Fertilizer requirement

- · Compost : 12.5 t / ha, NPK : 20:60:50 kg / ha as basal application

## Top dressing

- · Top dress @ 12.5 kg N / ha at 60 and 90 days after sowing.
- · Earthing up the crop adequately after first top dressing.
- · Irrigate the crop immediately after every top dressing.

## Foliar application

- · Foliar  spray  of  100  ppm  boric  acid  or  0.5  %  zinc  sulphate  to  the  male  parent  at initiation flowering to improve the pollen viability and pollen production.
- · Foliar spray of salicylic acid @ 250 ppm at 90 days after sowing for increased seed set.
- · Foliar spray of 2 % DAP 4 times at 10 days interval during boll development period (60, 70, 80 and 90 days after sowing) for better development of crossed bolls.

## Emasculation and dusting for cross pollination

- · Emasculate and dust as far as possible all buds appearing during the first six weeks of reproductive phase to ensure good seed setting and development of bolls.
- · Emasculate the female buds on the previous day evening.
- · Smear pollen dust to the stigma of all the emasculated flowers for good number of boll formation.
- · Restrict  emasculation  to  each  day  evening  to  3  pm  to  6  pm  and  pollination  to morning between 10 am to 1 pm to ensure highest purity of hybrid seeds.
- · Choose optimum size of bud and avoid too young or too old buds for emasculation.
- · Cover the male buds with paper cover during previous day evening for their use on next day.
- · Cover emasculated buds with butter paper cover to avoid out crossing.
- · Close the crossing programme after 9 th week (from commencement of crossing) and remove all buds and flowers appearing subsequently to facilitate the development of crossed bolls.

## Topping

- · Top the plants either  manually  or  spray  Maleic  Hydrazide  @  100  ppm  at  90 th and 105 th days after sowing to enhance the sympodial branches formation.

## Harvesting

- · Harvest only fully bursted bolls.
- · Harvest the crop as 4 - 6 pickings depending on the cultivar.
- · Avoid later pickings (after 4 - 5 pickings) for seed purpose.

## Ginning

- · Gin the crossed kapas in separate gins erected in seed processing units or farm gins under the close supervision of the authorities concerned to ensure purity and avoid damage.
- · Remove hard locks and stained kapas.
- · After ginning, clean the seeds by hand picking to remove small, shrivelled and broken seeds.

## Pre-storage seed treatment

- · Treat the seeds with carbendazim @ 2 g / kg of seed.
- · Treat the seeds with halogen mixture (CaOCl2 + CaCO3 + arappu ( Albizzia amara ) leaf powder mixed in the ratio of 5:4:1@ 3 g / kg of seed as eco-friendly treatment.

## Storage

- · Store the seeds in gunny or cloth bags for short term storage (8 - 9 months) with a seed moisture content of 9 - 10 %.
- · Store the seeds in polylined gunny bag for medium term storage (12 - 15 months) with a seed moisture content of 7 - 8 %.
- · Store  the  seeds  in  700  gauge  polythene  bag  for  long  term  storage  (more  than  15 months) with a seed moisture content less than 6 %.

## (ii) JUTE ( Corchorus olitorius &amp; Corchorus capsularis )

## CROP MANAGEMENT

Jute can be successfully grown in Coimbatore, Cuddalore, Villupuram, Vellore, Tiruvannamalai, Chengleput and parts of Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Tiruchirapalli, Perambalur, Karur, Pudukkottai and Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi districts where assured supply of irrigation water is available  for its cultivation and retting for fibre extraction.

Soil  type :  Alluvial  sandy    loam,  clay  loamy    soils  are  best  suited    for  jute  production. Capsularis    jute  can  grow  even  in  standing  water  especially  towards  the  latter  part  of  its growth,  but  Olitorius    jute    will  not  thrive  in  standing  water.  The  latter  is  more  drought resistant and is therefore grown on lighter soils.

## Season : February

Land Preparation : Fine tilth is required since the seeds are very small

Manures and fertilizer application : Five tonnes of well decomposed farm yard manure is to be applied during last ploughing. Besides 20 kg per ha each of N, P2O5 and K O are to be applied. basally. Beds and channels are formed depending on water resources.

Varieties:

Capsularis  JRC 212, JRC 321, JRC  7447

Olitorius j JRO 524, JRO 878, JRO  7835

Crop duration

120 to 140 Days

## Seed rate and sowing : Seeds can be sown either by broadcasting or by line sowing.

| Jute type   | Seed rate (kg/ha)   | Seed rate (kg/ha)   | Spacing (cm)   | No. of            |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------|

Weed management : Hand weeding twice on 20 - 25 DAS and 35 - 40 DAS. Fluchloralin  can be sprayed at 3 days after sowing at the rate of 1.5 kg per  hectare  and  is followed  by irrigation.  Further one hand weeding can be taken up at 30 - 35 DAS.

Top dressing of fertiliser : Apply 10 kg of N at 20 - 25 days after  first  weeding  and  then again on 35 - 40 days after second weeding as top dressing. During periods of drought and fertilizer shortage, spray 8 kg of urea as 2 per cent urea solution (20 g urea in one litre of water) on jute foliage  on 40 - 45 as well as 70 - 75  DAS.

Water Management : Jute crop requires 500 mm of water. First irrigation is to be given after sowing  and  life  irrigation  on  fourth  day  after  sowing.  Afterwards  irrigation  can  be  given once  in  15  days.

Harvest : Jute crop can be harvested from 100 to 110 DAS but can be extended from 120 135 DAS depending on local cropping systems. Jute plants are left in the field for 3 - 4 days for leaf shedding. Then thick and thin plants are sorted out and bundled in convenient size. Yield : The green plant weight yield is 45 to 50 tonnes per hectare whereas the fibre yield is to 2.5 tonnes per hectare.

Tropical  crop.  Besides  temperature  and  rainfall,  light  (day  length)  plays  a  very important role  in  proper  growth  and  development  i.e.  tillering  of  cane.  A  long, warm  growing  season  with  a  high  incidence  of  solar  radiation  and  adequate moisture is required.Short day length decreases number of tillers. Under long day length conditions, plant produces more dry matter.

## CROP MANAGEMENT

## IV. MAIN FIELD PREPARATION FOR PLANTING  SUGARCANE

## 1. PREPARATION OF THE FIELD

- a) Wetland (Heavy soils): In wetlands, preparatory cultivation by ploughing the land  and bringing the soil to fine tilth could not be done.
- i. After harvest of the paddy crop, form irrigation and drainage channels of 40 cm depth and 30 cm width at intervals of 6 m across the field and along the field borders.
- ii. Form ridges and furrows with a spacing of 80 cm between rows with spade.
- iii. Stir the furrows with hand hoes and allow the soil to weather for 4 to 5 days.

## b) Problem soils with excessive soil moisture:

In problem soils, with excessive moisture  where  it is difficult  to drain  water, form raised beds at 30 cm intervals with Length - 5 m, Width - 80 cm, and Height -15 cm.

## c. Garden lands with medium and light soils:

In medium and light soil irrigated by flow or lift irrigation adopt the following:

- i. The initial ploughing with two disc plough followed by eight disc plough and using cultivator  for  deep  ploughing  followed  by  one  time  operation  of  rotovator    to pulverize  the soil to get  a fine tilth, free of weeds and  stubbles.
- ii. Level the field with laser leveler for effective and proper irrigation management.
- iii. Open ridges and furrows with tractor operated victory plough with a  depth  of 30cm  and  spacing of 80 cm between the rows for normal planting with furrow irrigation.
- iv. Open irrigation channels at 10 m intervals.

## 2. BASAL APPLICATION OF ORGANIC MANURES:

Apply  FYM  at  12.5  t/ha  or  compost  25  t/ha  or  filter  press  mud  at  37.5  t/ha before the last ploughing under gardenland conditions. In wetlands this may be applied along the furrows and incorporated well.

## Preparation of reinforced compost from sugarcane trash and pressmud:

Spread the sugarcane trash to a thickness of 15 cm over an area of 7 m x 3 m. Then  apply  pressmud  over  this  trash  to  a  thickness  of  5  cm.  Sprinkle  the  fertilizer mixture  containing  mussoorie rock phosphate, gypsum and urea in the ratio of 2:2:1 over  these  layers  at  the  rate  of  5  kg/100  kg  of  trash.  Moist  the  trash  and  pressmud layers adequately with water. Repeat this process till the entire  heap rises to a height of  1.5  m.  Use  cowdung  slurry  instead  of  water  to  moist  the  layer  wherever  it  is available.  Cover the heap with a layer of soil and pressmud  at 1:1 ratio to a thickness

of 15 cm. Leave the heap as such for three months for decomposition. Moist the heap once in 15 days. During rainy season, avoid moistening the heap. After three months, turn  and  mix  the  heap  thoroughly  and form a heap and leave it for one more month. Then turn and mix the heap thoroughly   at the end of the fourth month. Moist the heap once  in  15  days  during  4th  and  5th  month  also.  This  method  increases  the  manurial value of trash compost by increasing, N, P and Ca content.  It also  brings down the C:N ratio by 10 times as compared to raw cane  trash.

## 2. BASAL APPLICATION OF PERTILIZER

(i) If soil test is not done, follow blanket recommendation of NPK @ 300:100:200 kg/ha Apply super phosphate (625 kg/ha) along the furrows and incorporate with hand hoe. (ii) Soil test crop response based integrated plant nutrition system (STCRIPNS) recommendation  may  be  adopted  for  prescribing  fertilizer    doses    for    specified    yield targets.

*Maintenance dose

Note: FN, FP2O5 and K2O  are fertilizer N, P2O5 and K2O in kg ha -1 , respectively; T is the yield target in t ha -1 ; SN, SP and SK respectively are available N,P and K in kg ha -1 and ON, OP and OK are the quantities of N, P and K supplied through organic manure inkg ha -1 .

- (i)      Apply  37.5  kg  Zinc  sulphate/ha and 100 kg Ferrous sulphate + 12.5 t FYM/ha to zinc  and  iron deficient soils.
- (ii)    Application of sulphur in the form of Gypsum @ 500 kg /ha to sulphur deficient soils to increase the cane yield and juice quality.
- (iii) Basal application of 5 kg CuSO4 for copper deficient soil.

## V. MANAGEMENT OF MAIN FIELD OPERATIONS

## 1. PREPARATION OF SETTS FOR PLANTING

- a. Take seed material from short crop (6 to 7 months age) free from pests and diseases incidence.
- i) Detrash the cane with hand before setts preparation.
- ii. Use sharp knife or sett cutting machine developed by TNAU to prepare setts without splits.
- iii. Discard setts with damaged buds, sprouted buds, splits  etc.
- iv. Sett treatment with biofertilizers: Prepare slurry with 2 kg of Azospirillum/ Gluconacetobacter, 2kg  of phosphobacteria , 2 kg of SSB and dip the setts required  for  one  ha  for  30  minutes  and  plant.  (or)  sett  treatment  with powder  formulation  of Gluconacetobacter  diazotrophicus and  AM  fungi each @ 67.5 g/ha along with 75% of recommended dose of N &amp; P.

## 2. SETT TREATMENT

-  Select healthy setts for  planting.
-  The setts should be soaked in 100 litres of water dissolved with 50g Carbendazim, 200ml malathion and 1 kg urea for 15 minutes.
-  Treat setts with Aerated steam at 50°C for one hour to control primary  infection of grassy shoot disease.

## 3. SEED RATE

75000 two-budded setts/ha.

## 4. PLANTING

Different  systems  of  planting  is  not  found  to  influence  the  millable  cane population,  commercial cane sugar per cent, cane and sugar yield.

- a) Irrigate the furrows to form a slurry in wet land condition (Heavy soil)
- b) Place the setts along the centre of the furrows, accommodating  12  buds/metre length. Keep the buds in the lateral position and press gently beneath the soil in the furrow.
- c) Next day cover the exposed setts with soil to avoid exposure of setts to sunlight.
- d) Plant more setts near the channel or double row planting at every 10 th row for gap filling, at later stage.
- e) In dry/ garden land dry method of planting may be followed. First arrange the setts along the furrows, cover the setts with soil and then irrigate.

## Improved technologies on cane planting systems

## Mechanisation of planting

- · TNAU mechanical  planter is useful for cost effective    planting    with  saving  of Rs.3750  / ha and it can cover an area of  1.5ha/day
- · Reduces the human labour drudgery and seed rate up to 5 tones/ha.
- · Paired row system of planting double side planting of sugarcane setts with 150 + 30  cm spacing for Astraf 8000 series (Mechanical harvester) operated areas and 150    +    30    cm  spacing  for  New  Holland  4000  series  operated  areas  may  be

- adopted with single row of cane planting.
- · Sugarcane  cultivates  under  subsurface  drip  system  the  laterals  may  be  placed 20cm depth in the furrows and setts are placed 5cm above the laterals.
- · For sustainable sugarcane initiative system (SSI) transplanting  young  chip  bud seedling raised in portray (25-35 days old) in wide spacing (5x2 feet) in the main field with  drip  fertigation system.
- · Daincha / Sunhemp intercropping in the wider spaced cane cultivated area for improving  soil  health  and  reduce  the  weed  infestation.  It  also  reduces  early shoot borer incidences and increases cane yield.
- · Plant the setts on one side of the ridge for 80 cm spacing  in heavy  soil to avoid sett rot  resulted better germination
- · Sow rhizobium treated green manure seeds @ 10kg/ha on the opposite side of ridge with 10cm. Spacing on or before 3 days after planting.
- · Incorporate the green manure crop 50-60 days after planting in between interow of  wider spaced crop and give partial earthing up with recommended dose of N fertilizer  on 90 - 100  day after planting.
- · Introduction of power weeder with rotovator for weeding  and earthing  up with ridger  to save the cost on labour and also to reduce human drudgery.

## 5. FILLING UP GAPS

- ii. Fill the gaps, if any, within 30 days after planting with sprouted setts.
- iii. Gap filling with two budded setts/ poly bag seedlings within 15 to 20 days after planting to maintain optimum plant  stand.
- iv. Maintain  adequate  moisture  for  3  weeks  for  proper  establishment  of  the sprouted setts.

## 6. TRASH MULCHING

Mulch  the ridges uniformly  with cane trash to a thickness  of 10 cm within  a week after  planting.      It  helps  to  tide  over  drought,  conserves  moisture,  reduce  weed population and minimise shoot borer incidence. Mulch the field with trash after 21 days of planting in heavy soil and wetland  conditions.  Avoid trash mulching in areas where incidence of termites is  noticed.

## 7. RAISING INTER CROPS

In areas of adequate irrigation, sow one row of soybean or blackgram or greengram along the centre of the ridge on the 3rd day of planting. Intercropping of daincha or sunhemp  along  ridges  and  incorporation  of  the  same  on  the  45 th day  during  partial earthing up helps  to increase  the soil fertility, and also the cane yield.

## 8. WEED MANAGEMENT

## WEED MANAGEMENT IN PURE CROP OF SUGARCANE

- i. Wherever weed menace is higher, one line weeding along the crop row and spade digging of ridges have to be done on 30, 60 and 90 DAP
- ii. Spray Atrazine 1 kg or Oxyflurofen 750 ml/ha mixed in 500 liters of water as pre emergence herbicide on the 3rd day of planting, using deflector or fan type nozzle fitted with knapsack sprayer.
- iii. Pre emergence application of atrazine @ 1.0 kg ha -1 on 3 DAP followed by post emergence directed application of glyphosate @ 10 ml / litre of water on 45 DAP with hood+ one  hand weeding on 90 DAP registered the maximum cane yield.

- iv. If the parasitic weed striga is a problem, Pre-emergence application of Atrazine 1.0 kg/ha on 3 DAP + hand weeding on 45 DAP with an earthing up on 60 DAP combined  with  post-emergence  sparaying  of  2,4-D  @  6  g  (0.6%)  +  Urea  @ 20 g (2%) / litre of water on 90 DAP + Trash mulching 5 t/ha on 120 DAP.
- v. Pre- plant application of glyphosate at 2.0 kg h a-1 along with 2% ammonium sulphate at 21  days before planting of sugarcane followed by post emergence direct spraying of glyphosate  at 2.0 kg h a-1 along with 2% ammonium sulphate with a special hood on 30 DAP suppressed the nut sedges (Cyperus rotandus ) and provided weed free environment.
- vi. If herbicide is not applied work the junior-hoe along the ridges on 25, 55 and 85 days after planting for removal of weeds and proper stirring. Remove the weeds along the furrows with hand hoe. Otherwise operate power tiller fitted with tynes for  intercultivation.
- vii. Control  of  creeper  weeds  post  emergence  directed  application  of  fernoxone (2, 4 -D sodium salt) @ 2 gm + 10 gm of urea per liter of water may be sprayed over the creeper  weeds.

## Weed management in Sugarcane intercropping system

Premergence application of Thiobencarb @ 1.25 kg ai/ha under intercropping system in Sugarcane  with  Soybean,  blackgram  or  groundnut  gives  effective  weed  control.  Raising intercrops  is  not found to affect the cane yield and quality.

## 9. EARTHING UP

After  application  of  3rd  dose  fertilizer  (90  days),  work  victory  plough  along  the ridges  for efficient  and  economical  earthing  up.  At  150  days  after  planting,  earthing  up may be done with spade.

## 10. DETRASHING

Remove the dry cane leaves on 150 th and 210 th day to avoid borer infestation.

## 11. PROPPING

Do double line propping with trash twist at the age of 210 days of the crop.

## 12. TOP DRESSING WITH FERTILIZERS

Apply 275 kg of nitrogen and 112.5 kg of K O/ha in three equal splits at 30, 60 and 90 days

## a. Soil application

Coastal and flow irrigated belts (assured water supply areas). In the case of lift irrigation belt, apply 225 kg of nitrogen and 112.5 kg of K O/ha in three equal splits at 30, 60 and 90 days  (water  scarcity  areas).  For  jaggery  areas,  apply  175  kg  of  nitrogen  and  112.5  kg  of K2O/ha in three equal splits on 30, 60 and 90 days.

## NITROGEN SAVING

- a. Neem Cake Blended Urea : Apply 67.5 kg of N/ha + 27.5 kg of Neem  Cake  at 30 days  and repeat on 60th and 90th  days.

Note : Neem cake blending: Powder the required quantity of neem cake and mix it with urea thoroughly and keep it for 24 hours. Thus, 75 kg of nitrogen/ha can be saved by this method.

- b. Azospirillum : Mix 12 packets (2400 g)/ha of Azospirillum inoculant or TNAU Biofert -1 with 25 kg of FYM and 25 kg soil and apply  near the clumps  on 30th day of planting.  Repeat   the same on 60th day with another 12 packets (2400 gm). Repeat the above on the other side of the crop row on the 90th day (for lift irrigated belt).
- c. Band placement: Open deep furrows of 15 cm depth with hand hoes and place the  fertilisers in the form of band and cover it properly.
- d. Subsurface application: Application of 255 kg of Nitrogen in the form of urea along with potash at 10cm depth with 15cm intervals by the side of the cane clump will result in the saving of 20 kg N/ha without any yield reduction.

Nutritional Disorders :

Nitrogen  deficiency  : All leaves  of  sugarcane  exhibit  a  yellow  -  green  colour    and retardation  of  growth. Cane stalks are smaller in diameter and premature drying of older leaves. Roots  attain  a greater length but are smaller in diameter.

Phosphorus  deficiency    : Reduction    in  length  of  sugarcane    stalks,  diameters    of  which taper rapidly  at growing points. The colour of the leaves is greenish blue, narrow and some what  reduce  length.  Reduced  tillering,  decreased  shoot  /  root  ratio  with  restricted  root development.

Potassium deficiency: Depressed growth, yellowing and marginal drying of older leaves and development of slender stalks. An orange, yellow colour appears in the older lower leaves which  develop  numerous  chlorotic  spots  that  later  become  brown  with  dead  centre.  A reddish  discoloration  which  is  confined  to  the  epidermal  cells  of  the  upper  surfaces  and midribs of the leaves. The young leaves appear to have developed from a common  point giving  a 'Bunched  top'  appearance.  Poor root growth with less member of root hairs.

Zinc deficiency: Mild zinc deficiency exhibit a tendency to develop anthrocyanin  pigments in the leaves.  Pronounced  bleaching  of the green  colour along the major veins and also striped  effect due  to a loss of chlorophyll along the veins. In acute cases of zinc  deficiency there  is evidences  of  necrosis and growth ceases at the growing point (meristem).

Iron deficiency: Symptoms of Iron deficiency are generally seen in young leaves where pale stripes  with scanty chlorophyll content occur between parallel lines. In advanced  stages  of deficiency    the  young  leaves  turn  completely  white,  even  in  the  veins.  Root  growth  also becomes restricted.

Boron deficiency : Boron  deficiency  could  be seen in the cane  by depressed  growth, development of distorted and chlorotic leaves  and the presence  of definite  leaf and stalks lesions.  In extreme  cases of boron deficiency the plant will die.

## Importance of Balanced Nutrition

The soil fertility has declined in many sugarcane growing  areas of the state due to improper  and some times, distorted fertilizer schedules  adopted  over the years  under intensive  cultivation  of the crop. Hence balanced application of fertilizer based on soil test values and crop requirement is essential.

- c.
- Sugarcane for jaggery manufacture (plant as well as ratoon crop) 225 : 62.5 : 112.5 kg N, P2O5 and K2O per ha

## 13. BIOFERTILIZER FOR SUGARCANE

Azospirillum is  the  common  biofertilizer  recommended  for  N  nutrition  which  could colonize the roots of sugarcane and fix atmospheric nitrogen to the tune of about 50 to 75 kg  nitrogen  per  ha  per  year.  Recently,  another  endophytic  nitrogen  fixing  bacterium, Gluconacetobacter  diazotrophicus isolated from sugarcane can able to fix more nitrogen than Azospirillum . It colonizes throughout the sugarcane and increases the total N content. In soil, it can also colonize the roots and able to solubilize the phosphate, iron and Zn. It can also enhance the crop growth, yield of sugarcane and sugar content of  the juice. Since it is more efficient than Azospirillum , this new organism was test-verified in various centres and released as new biofertilizer Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus TNAU Biofert-I. Phosphobacteria as P solubiliser are recommended for sugarcane crop.

## Sett treatment with Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus

Before  planting  the  sugarcane  setts  can  be  treated  with  ten  packets  (2  kg)  per  ha  of Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus prepared as slurry with 250 L of water.

## Soil application Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus

Twelve packets (2.4 kg) per ha is recommended for soil application each at 30th, 60th and 90th day after planting under irrigated condition.

## Same method of application can be followed for Phosphobacteria.

- · If basal application is not followed apply the same with 30th day, 60th day and 90th day after planting and copiously irrigate the field.
- · Biofertilizer treatment should be done just before planting.
- · Immediately plant/ Irrigate after biofertilizer application
- · Do not mix biofertilizer along with chemical fertilizer.
- · Reduces  25%  of  the  recommended  N  to  reap  the  benefits  of  biofertilizer application

## 14. WATER MANAGEMENT

Irrigate the crop depending upon the need during different phases of the crop. Germination phase (0 - 35 days) :

Provide shallow wetting with 2 to 3 cm depth of water at shorter intervals especially for sandy  soil  for  enhancing  the  germination.  Sprinkler  irrigation  is  the  suitable  method    to satisfy  the  requirement, during initial stages.

Later,  irrigation  can  be  provided  at  0.75,  0.75  and  0.50  IW/CPE  ratio  during  tillering, grandgrowth and maturity  phases  respectively.  The  irrigation  intervals  in  each  phase  are given below:

## Drip Irrigation:

- o Planting setts obtained from 6-7 months old healthy nursery and planted in paired row planting system with the spacing of 30x30x30 / 150 cm. for manual harvest and 30/150 cm for machine harvest
- o Eight setts per metre per row have to be planted on either sides of the ridge thus making it as four row planting system.
- o 12 mm drip laterals have to be placed in the middle  ridge  of each  furrow with  the  lateral spacing of 240 cm &amp; 8 'Lph' clog free drippers should  be placed  with  a  spacing    of  75  cm  on the  lateral  lines.  The  lateral  length should not exceed more than 30-40 m.
- o Phosphorus @ 62.5 kg ha -1 has to be applied as basal at the time of planting.
- o Nitrogen  and  Potassium  @  275:112.5  kg  ha -1 have  to  be  injected  into  the system as urea and muriate of potash by using 'Ventury' assembly in 10-12

equal splits starting from 15 to 150- 180 days after planting.

- o Low or medium in nutrient status soil to be given with 50 per cent additional dose of Nitrogen and Potassium.
- o Irrigation  is  given  once  in  three  days  based  on  the  evapo-transpiration demand of the crop.
- o The  double  side  planting  of  sugarcane  with  lateral  spacing  of  120+40  cm under subsurface  drip fertigation system improves the yield.
- o Application  of  125  %  recommended  NPK  (Rec  NPK-275  :63:112.5  kg  /ha  ) through fertigation under pit system of planting inprove the yield and yield attributes.

## Concept of fertigation

- -Fertigation is the judicious application of fertilizers by combining with irrigation water.
- -Fertigation can be achieved through fertilizer tank, venturi System, Injector Pump,  Non- Electric Proportional Liquid Dispenser (NEPLD) and Automated system.
- -Recommended N &amp; K @ of 275 and 112.5 kg. ha -1 may be applied in 14 equal splits with 15 days interval from 15  DAP.
- -25 kg N and 8 kg K2O per ha per split.
- -Urea and MOP (white potash) fertilisers can be used as N and K sources respectively
- -Fertigation up to 210 DAP can also be recommended.

## Advantages of Fertigation

- -Ensures a regular flow of water as well as nutrients resulting in increased growth rates for higher yields
- -Offers greater versatility in the timing of the nutrient application to meet specific crop demands
- -Improves availability of nutrients and their uptake by the  roots
- -Safer application method which eliminates the danger of burning the plant root system
- -Offers simpler and more convenient application than soil application of fertilizer thus saving time, labour, equipment and energy
- -Improves fertilizer use  efficiency
- -Reduction of soil compaction and mechanical damage to the crops
- -Potential reduction of environmental contamination
- -Convenient use of compound and ready-mix nutrient solutions containing also small concentration of micronutrients.

## 15. Contingent plan

## Gradual widening of furrow:

At the time of planting, form furrow at a width of 30 cm initially. After that, widen the furrow to 45 cm on 45th day during first light earthing up and subsequently deepen the furrow on 90th day to save 35% of water.

## Drought Management:

- i. Soak the setts in lime solution (80 kg Kiln lime in 400 lit) for one hour.
- ii. Plant in deep furrows of 30 cm  depth.
- iii. Foliar spray of kel and urea each at 2.5 per cent during moisture stress period at 15 days interval.
- iv. Foliar spray of Kaolin (60 g in 1 ltr. of water) to alleviate the water stress.
- v. Under water scarcity condition, alternate furrow and skip furrow method is beneficial.
- vi. Apply 125 kg of MOP additionally at 120 day of planting.
- vii. Basal incorporation of coir waste @ 25 tonnes/ha at the time of last ploughing. viii. Removal of dry trash at 5 th month and leave it as mulch, in the  field.

## General Recommendations

- · Select healthy setts for planting. In the seed crop, select plants which do not show symptoms  of  red  rot,  smut,  grassy  shoot  and  ratoon  stunting.  Setts  showing  red colour at the cut end and hollows should be rejected.
- · In fields which had shown high level of red rot disease, follow crop rotation with rice.
- · Sett treatment with carbendazim before planting (carbendazim 50 WP @ 0.05% along with 1.0% urea for 15 minutes.
- · Treat setts with aerated steam at 50°C for one hour to control primary infection of smut and grassy shoot disease.
- Clumps  infected  by  grassy  shoot,  smut  and  ratoon  stunting  diseases  should  be uprooted and destroyed.

## 17. PRE-HARVEST PRACTICES

## a. Apply cane ripeners

- i. Spray Sodium metasilicate 4 kg/ha in 750 litres of water on the foliage of crop at 6 months after planting.
- ii. Repeat the same twice at 8th and 10th months to obtain higher cane yield and sugar percentage.

## b. Assessing maturity of crops

- i. Assess the maturity by hand refractometer brix survey and 18 to 20 per cent brix indicates optimum maturity for  harvest.
- ii. Top-bottom ratio of H.R.Brix reading should be 1:1.

## 18. HARVESTING

- i. Early varieties have to be harvested at 10 to 11 months age and mid-season varieties at 11 to 12 months age.
- ii. Harvest the cane at peak maturity. Cut the cane to the ground level  for both  plant and  ratoon crops.

## B. RATOON CROP

## I. MANAGEMENT OF THE FIELD AFTER HARVEST OF THE PLANT CROP

Complete the following operations within 10 days of harvest of plant crop to obtain better establishment and uniform sprouting of shoots.

- 1. Remove the trash from the field. Do not burn it. Irrigate the field copiously.
- 2. Follow stubble shaving with sharp spades to a depth of 4 - 6 cm along the ridges at proper moisture.

- 3. Work  with  cooper plough along with sides of the ridges to break the compaction.
- 4. The gappy areas in the ratoon sugarcane crop should be filled within 30 days of stubble  shaving.  The  sprouted  cane  stubbles  taken  from  the  same  field  is  the best  material  for  full  establishment.  The  next  best  method  is  gap  filling  with seedlings raised in polybags.
- 5. Apply basal dose of organic manure and super phosphate as recommended for plant crop.

## II. MANAGEMENT OF THE CROP

- 1. 25% additional N application on 5-7 days after ratooning.
- 2. Foliar  spray  of  Ferrous  sulphate  at  2.5  kg/ha  on  the  15th  day.  If  chlorotic condition persists, repeat the spray twice further at 15 days interval. Add urea 2.5 kg/ha in the last spray.
- 3. Hoeing and weeding  on 20th day and 40th to 50th day.
- 4. First top dressing on 25th day, 2nd on 45th to 50th  day.
- 5. Final manuring on 70th to 75th day.
- 6. Partial earthing up on 50th day. If junior-hoe is worked two or three times upto 90th day, partial earthing up is not  necessary.
- 7. Final earthing up on 90th  day.
- 8. Detrashing on 120th and 180th day.
- 9. Trash twist propping on 180th  day.
- 10. Harvest after 11 months.

## C. SHORT CROP (NURSERY CROP) SELECTION OF PROPER PLANTING MONTHS FOR RAISING NURSERY CROP IN

## RELATION TO MAIN FIELD PLANTING

Raise six to seven months old nursery crop prior to main field planting as follows:

## Raise nursery crop during

Main field planting

June

December - January (early season)

July

February - March (Mid  season)

August

April - May (Late season)

Dec - Apr

June - September (Special season)

## II. PRECAUTIONS IN MAINTAINING NURSERY CROP

Adopt  similar  production  techniques  for  raising  short  crop  with  the  following modifications.

- 1. Do not detrash
- 2. Do not prop
- 3. Harvest at 6 to 7 months  age
- 4. Remove trash by hand while preparing setts
- 5. Avoid bud damage
- 6. Transport  the  seed  material  to  other  places  in  the  forms  of  full  canes  with trash intact.
- 7. Apply 50 kg of urea as top dressing additionally before one month of cutting the seed cane.

## CROP PHYSIOLOGY

Foliar spray of TNAU Sugarcane Booster @ 1.0, 1.5 and 2 kg/acre in 200 litres of water at 45,60 and 75 days after planting enhances cane growth and weight, internodal  length, cane yield, sugar content and offers drought  tolerance.

## IMPROVED  TECHNIQUES  IN BIOLOGICAL CONTROL Improved  adult feeding techniques  for Trichogramma

- · Trichogramma adult  feeding  through  cotton  swabs  will  trap  the  adults  which  get entangled in the sticky cotton lint. To avoid this, a better adult feeding technique is developed.
- · Make small dotted holes in a thick mylar film sheet or old film  negatives  by  using  a sewing  machine, leaving a gap of 1 cm between the dotted holes horizontally. One side of the sheet (7 x 6 cm) will be smooth and the other will be eruptive.  Streak 50% honey  solution  on the smooth  side by using a camel hair brush. Then fold the sheet  in  such  a  way  that  the  honey-smeared  surface    is    on  the  inside  and  the eruptive  surface  outside  and  staple  it.  The  gap  between  the  dotted  holes  will provide  free  movement  for  the  adults,  which  imbibe  the  honey  through  eruptive surface. In this method, the adults do not get trapped in the honey solution.

## Special problem: Woolly aphid ( Ceratovacuna lanigera )

## Attacked plants could be recognized from a distance by the following symptoms:

- · White appearance of the lower surface of colonized top leaves; sooty mould growth and  the honeydew exudations deposited on the upper surface of lower  or  adjacent leaves; occasional white woolly deposition on the ground under severe colonization.
- · Established  colonies,  characterized  by  the  presence  of  members    most    of    which showed   white  woolly  filaments,  can  be  generally  observed  from  the  second  leaf downward    in  the  grown-up    crop.    At  low  numbers,  colonization  on  leaves  is restricted  to  a  short    perpendicular    distance    on    either    side  of  the  midrib  for  a considerable length of the leaf.
- · Among the plants the attack is seen only in patches.
- · Since the infestation has become a major cause for concern, major initiatives have been started by the Department of Agriculture and ICAR.

## Management strategies:

- · Enforcement of compulsory IPM measures against woolly aphid infestation in newly planted and ratoon sugarcane fields by invoking suitable provisions of the State Pest Act of the State.
- · Harvesting of the entire matured sugarcane crop on priority  for crushing  as well burning  of the  trash.
- · Application  of  granular  systemic    insecticides    after  two  days  of  irrigation    may reduce the infestation of aphids even up to 30  days.
- · Promotion  of  paired  or  wider  row  cultivation  of  sugarcane  for  taking  effective control measures.
- · Conservation and augmentation of identified potential biocontrol agents like Dipha aphidivora, Micromus and coccinellids in woolly aphid infested fields.
- · Release of Dipha aphidivora @ 1000/ha or Micromus igorotus @ 2500/ha wherever possible.
- · Conservation  of  lepidopteran  predator, Dipha  aphidivora predator  population  in limited areas of sugarcane crop for further distribution and use thereof.
- · Regular surveillance and monitoring of sugarcane woolly aphid for timely

forewarning and adoption of IPM measures including judicious use of recommended  pesticides  and    bio-pesticides    ( Metarhizium  anisopliae , Beauveria bassiana , Verticillium  lecanii ).

- · Avoiding transportation of aphid infested leaves from one location to another.
- · Avoiding use of infested cane for seed purpose.
- · Ensuring that the insecticides treated leaves are not used as fodder.

## General Recommendations

- · Select healthy setts for planting. In the seed crop, select plants which do not show symptoms  of  red  rot,  smut,  grassy  shoot  and  ratoon  stunting.  Setts  showing  red colour at the cut end and hollows should be rejected.
- · In fields which had shown high level of red rot disease, follow crop rotation with rice.
- · Sett treatment with carbendazim before planting (carbendazim 50 WP @ 0.05% along with 1.0% urea for 15 minutes.
- · Treat setts with aerated steam at 50°C for one hour to control primary infection of smut and grassy shoot disease.

Clumps  infected  by  grassy  shoot,  smut  and  ratoon  stunting  diseases  should  be uprooted and destroyed.

## PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY

## Introduction

Tropical sugarbeet ( Beta vulgaris spp. Vulgaris  var  altissima  Doll )  is  a  biennial  sugar producing tuber crop, grown in temperate countries. This crop constitutes 30%  of  total world    production  and  distributed  in  45  countries.  Now  tropical  sugarbeet  hybrids  are gaining  momentum  in  tropical  and  sub  tropical  countries  including  Tamil  Nadu    as  a promising  energy  crop and alternative  raw materials for the production of ethanol. Apart from  sugar  production,  the value  added  products like ethanol  can also be extracted from sugarbeet.  The ethanol  can be blended  with petrol or diesel   to the extent of 10% and used as bio-fuel. The sugarbeet waste material viz., beet top used as green fodder, beet pulp used as cattle feed and filter cake from industry used as organic manure.

Tropical sugarbeet now emerged as commercial field  crop  because  of  the  favourable characters like (i) tropical sugarbeet hybrids suitable for Tamil Nadu (ii) Shorter duration  of 5  to    6  months  (iii)  needs  moderate  water  requirement  of  60-80  cm.  (iv)  higher  sugar content of 12 - 15% (v) improve soil conditions because of tuber crop and (vi) grow well in saline and  alkali  soil.  The  harvesting period of sugarbeet coincides  with March - June, the human resource  of sugar factory in  the off season may efficiently utilized for processing of sugarbeet in the sugar mills, which helps in continuous functioning of sugar  mills.

## Hybrids and duration

The  tropical  sugarbeet  hybrids  suitable  for  cultivation  in  Tamil  Nadu  are  Cauvery, Indus and Shubhra. The duration of these tropical hybrids will be 5 to  6  months  depending on  climatic  conditions prevailing during crop growth period.

## Climate and season

Tropical  sugarbeet  require  good  sunshine  during  its  growth  period.  The  crop  does not  prefer  high  rainfall as high  soil moisture  or  continuous  heavy  rain  may  affect development of tuber and sugar synthesis. Tropical sugarbeet can be sown in SeptemberNovember  coincide  with    North    East  monsoon  with  a  rainfall  of  300  -  350  mm  well distributed across the growing period which favours vegetative growth and base for root enlargement.  The  optimum  temperature  for  germination  is  20  -  25 C,  for  growth  and 0 development 30 - 35 C and for sugar accumulation in 25- 35 C. 0 0

## Season

Tropical  sugarbeet  is  sown  in  September  to  November  and  harvested  during    March and  May.

## Field preparation

Well drained sandy loam and clayey loam soils having  medium  depth (45' cm) with fairly  good organic status are suitable. Tropical sugarbeet  require deep ploughing  (45 cm) and followed by  2 - 3 ploughing to obtain a good soil tilth condition for favorable seed germination.  Ridges  and  furrows are formed at 50 cm  apart.

## Seeds and sowing

Optimum  population  is  1,00,000  -  1,20,000  /ha.    Hence    use    only    pellated seeds    1,20,000  Nos  /ha  which  require  6  pockets  (3.6kg  /  ha.-One  pocket  contains 20000 seeds (600 g)]. The recommended spacing is 50 x 20 cm. The pellated seed is dippled  at 2 cm  depth  in the  sides  of  ridges  at 20  cm  apart.  45 x 15 cm spacing found to be optimum for higher root yield.

## Weeding and Earthing up

The crops should be maintained  weed free situation  upto 75 days. Pretilachlor 50 EC @ 0.5  Kg ai/ha or Pendimethalin @ 1.0 lit /ha can be dissolved in 300 litres of water and sprayed with hand operated sprayer on 0- 2 rd day after sowing, followed by hand weeding on 25 th day and 50th day after sowing. The earthing up operations coincides with top dressing of N fertilizer.

## Irrigation

Tropical  sugarbeet  is  very  sensitive  to  water  stagnation  in  soil  at  all  stages  of crop growth. Irrigation should be based on soil type and climatic condition.  Pre-sowing irrigation  is essential  since  at the time of sowing, sufficient soil moisture is must for proper  irrigation.  First irrigation  is crucial  for the early establishment of the crop. For loose  textured  sandy  loam  soil irrigation  once  in 5 to 7  days and for heavy textured clay loam soil once in 8 - 10 days is recommended. The irrigation  has to  be stopped at least 2 to 3 weeks  before harvest.  At the time of harvest,  if the soil is too dry and hard it    is  necessary  to  give  pre  harvest  irrigation  for  easy  harvest.    Light  and  frequent irrigation  is recommended for maintaining optimum soil moisture. Water requirement is 800 - 850 mm.

## B. CROP MANAGEMENT

## 1. Soil

All types of soil with good drainage.

## 2. Preparatory cultivation

Plough 2 to 3 times to obtain a good tilth and form ridges and furrows at 50 cm spacing.

## 3. Nutrient management

- · Spread FYM or compost at 25 t/ha and incorporate the manure into the soil during ploughing.
- · Apply NPK fertilizers as per soil test recommendation as for as possible. If soil testing is not done, follow the blanket recommendations of 100:50:40 of NPK in kg/ha. Apply full dose of P, K and 50% N basally before planting.
- · Top dressing of 50% N on 30 DAP.
- · Repeat the application of 75 kg N/ha after each cut for sustaining higher yield.

## 4. Planting

- i. Irrigate through the furrows and plant one rooted slip per hill.
- ii. Spacing 50 x 50 cm and 40,000 rooted slips are required to plant one hectare.

## 5. Irrigation management

Immediately after planting, give life irrigation on the third day and thereafter once in 10 days.

## 6. Weed Management

Hoeing and weeding on 30th day after planting. Earthing up should be practiced once after every three harvests.

## 7. Plant protection

As per CIB&amp;RC, insecticide is not recommended for the management of pests in fodder crops. No insecticide is registered/label claimed against the pests of fodder crops.

## 8. Harvest

First harvest on 75 - 80 days after planting. Subsequent cuts at the interval of 45 days.

## 9. Green fodder yield

As green fodder under irrigated conditions, a pure crop yields about 270 to 360 t/ha of green fodder.

## Note :

- · Guinea grass can be intercropped with Desmanthus (Velimasal) at 3:1 ratio and can be harvested together and fed to the animals.
- · Rooted slips uprooted from 90 days old crop can be used for further propagation

## B. CROP MANAGEMENT

I. GREEN FODDER PRODUCTION

## 1. Soil

Well drained black cotton soils are well suited. It can be raised in alkaline soils also.

## 2.  Preparatory cultivation

Plough three or four times with iron plough to obtain good tilth. Form beds of size 10 m 2 or 20 m  depending on the availability of water and slope of land. 2

## 3. Nutrient management

- · Spread FYM or compost at 25 t/ha and incorporate the manure into the soil during

ploughing.

- · Apply NPK fertilizers as per soil test recommendations as for as possible. If soil testing is not done, follow the blanket recommendation of 25:120:40 kg NPK/ha.
- · Apply the full dose NPK of 25:120:40 basally before sowing.

## 4. Sowing

- · Seed treatment: Treat the seeds with 3 packets (600 g) of Rhizobium and 3 packets (600 g) Phosphobacteria before sowing.
- · Seed rate: 20 kg/ha. Good quality seeds free from Cuscuta seeds should be used.
- · Spacing: 25 cm x 10 cm

## 5. Irrigation management

Irrigate immediately after sowing, life irrigation on the third day and thereafter once in a week.

## 6. Weed management

Hand weeding is given as and when necessary.

## 7. Plant protection

As per CIB&amp;RC, insecticide is not recommended for the management of pests in fodder crops. No insecticide is registered/label claimed against the pests of fodder crops.

## 8. Harvesting

First harvest at 65 - 70 days after sowing. Subsequent harvests are made at intervals of 20 - 25 days.

## 9. Green fodder yield

As green fodder under irrigated conditions, a pure crop yields about 80-130 t/ha/year (14 harvests) of green fodder.

## II.SEED PRODUCTION

## 1. Season

Seed production is practiced once in a year during summer months. The crop should be harvested during first week of March and allowed for seed production in such a way that the peak period of flowering should coincide with summer days.

## 2. Isolation

Plough with an iron plough twice and three or four times with country plough to obtain good tilth. Form ridges and furrows at 6 m x 1 m.

## 3. Nutrient management

- · Spread FYM or compost at 25 t/ha and incorporate the manure into the soil during ploughing
- · Apply NPK fertilizer as per soil test recommendations as far as possible. If the soil testing is not done, follow the blanket recommendations of 10:60:30 kg NPK/ha.
- · Apply full dose of NPK basally before sowing.

## 4. Sowing

- · Seed treatment: Seeds are hard and require scarification to obtain high and uniform germination. Scarification of seeds can be done by pounding the seeds with sand in

mortar.  Acid  scarification  can  also  be  done  by  dipping  the  seeds  in  concentrated sulphuric  acid  for  three  minutes  and  washing  thoroughly  with  tap  water.  Another easiest method is hot water treatment by soaking the seeds in hot water (80 o C) for 4  minutes  (boiling  water  removed  from  the  flame  and  kept  for  4  minutes  comes down to 80 o C). A still simpler method would be to bring water to boil (100 o C) in a vessel,  take  it  out  of  the  flame  and  immediately  pour  it  over  the  seeds  and  keep them for 3 to 4 minutes. Then, the hot water may be poured out and cold water added to steep the seeds over night. Seeds can also be simply soaked in plain water for 72 hrs before sowing. Treat the seeds with 3 packets (600 g) of Rhizobium and  3 packets (600 g) Phosphobacteria before sowing.

- · Seed rate: 10 kg/ha.
- · Spacing: 2 m x 1 m

## 5. Irrigation management

This may be done when the crop is raised under irrigated condition. Once established, this plant can withstand several months of dry weather. However, to ensure rapid seedling growth, the land should be adequately moist up to 5 - 6 months. In summer, irrigation once in 6 weeks is adequate.

## 6. Weed management : Hoeing and weeding are given as and when necessary.

## 7. Plant protection

As  per  CIB&amp;RC,  insecticide  is  not  recommended  for  the  management  of  pests  in fodder crops. No insecticide is registered/label claimed against the pests of fodder crops.

## 8. Harvesting

Plant  can  be  harvested  as  short  as  6  months  after  planting.  However,  the  initial cutting should not be done until the trunk has attained at least 3 cm diameter or the plant has completed one seed production cycle. Harvests can be repeated once in 40 - 80 days depending upon growth and season. In drought prone areas, allow the trees to grow for two years to ensure deep root penetration before commencing harvest. The trees can be cut at 90 to 100 cm height from ground level. For poles and fuel, allow the tree to grow straight without cutting for 2.5 or 5 years as the case may be.

## 9. Green fodder yield

As green fodder under irrigated conditions, a pure crop yields about 80 to 110 t/ha of green fodder. Under rainfed conditions 40 t/ha of green fodder is obtained after 2 years of initial growth and pruning to a height of 100 cm.

## 12. MUSHROOM CULTIVATION

Agriculture  will  continue  to  be  the  main  strength  of  Indian  economy.  With  the variety of agricultural crops grown today, we have achieved food security by prodding about 240 million tonnes of food grains. However, our struggle to achieve nutritional security is still  on.  In  future,  the  ever  increasing  population,  depleting  agricultural  land,  changes  in environment, water shortage and need for quality food products at competitive rates are going  to  be  the  vital  issues  and  secondary  agricultural  vocations  are  going  to  occupy  a prominent place to fill the void quality food requirements. The demand for quality food and novel  products  is  increasing  with  the  changes  in  life  style  and  income.  To  meet  these challenges  and  to  provide  food  and  nutritional  security  to  our  people,  it  is  important  to diversify  the  agricultural  activities  in  areas  like  horticulture.  Diversification  in  any  farming systems imparts sustainability. Mushrooms are one such component that not only impart diversification  but  also  help  in  addressing  the  problems  of  quality  food,  health  and environmental  sustainability.  The  present  century  is  going  to  be  a  century  of  functional foods from synthetic chemicals and mushroom cultivation fits very well into this category and is going to be an important vocation.

Mushrooms represent microbial technology that recycles agricultural residues into food and manure. It is solid state fermentation system in which crop residues are converted into valuable food rich in microbial protein. These are important source of quality protein, minerals  and  various  novel  compounds  of  medicinal  value,  do  not  compare  for  land  and have very high productivity per unit area and time. These are considered to be the highest protein per unit area and time due to utilization of vertical space and short crop cycle. Due to  their  cultivation  under  controlled  conditions  the  water  requirements  is  less  than  any other  crop  grown  in  the  field  and  has  all  the  potentials  of  being  a  major  crop  in  coming years.

Mushroom  farming  today  is  being  practiced  in  more  than  100  countries  and  its production is increasing at an annual rate of 6-7%. In some developed countries of Europe and America, mushroom farming has attained the status of a high-tech industry with very high  levels  of  mechanization  and  automation.  China  leads  in  mushroom  production  and China alone is reported to grow more than 20 different types of mushroom at commercial scale and mushroom cultivation has become China's sixth largest industry. The USA is the second  largest  producer  of  mushroom  sharing  16%  of  the  world  output.  Presently,  three geographical  regions-  Europe,  America  and  East  Asia  contribute  to  about  96%  of  world mushroom production. With the rise in the income level, the demand for mushrooms at very low costs with the help of seasonal growing, state subsidies and capturing the potential markets in the world with processed mushrooms at costs not remunerative to the growers in other mushroom producing countries.

Commercial production of edible mushrooms represents unique exploitation of the microbial  technology  for  the  bio  conversion  of  the  agricultural,  industrial,  forestry  and household  waste  into  nutritious  and  proteinaceous  food.  Our  country  can  emerge  as  a major  player  in  mushroom  production  in  wake  of  availability  of  plenty  of  agricultural residues  and  labour.Integrating  mushroom  cultivation  in  wake  of  availability  of  plenty  of

agricultural  residues  and  labour.  Integrating  mushroom  cultivation  in  the  existing  farming systems will not only supplement the income of the farmers but also will promote proper recycling of agro-residues thereby improving soil health and promoting organic agriculture. In India, mushroom research started in1960s and the cultivation picked up in 1970s and new varieties were evolved in button and oyster mushroom during 1980s and 1990s. Since the year  2000,  our  country  is  progressing  keeping  in  pace  with  global  growth  by  developing technologies for cultivation of medicinal mushrooms.

India  has  varied  agro-climate,  abundance  of  agricultural  residues  and  plenty  of manpower making  it  suitable  for  cultivating  different  mushrooms.  Our  country  produces about 600 million tonnes of agricultural waste per annum and a major part of it is let out to decompose  naturally  or  burnt in  situ .  This  can  effectively  be  utilized  to  produce  highly nutritive  food  such  as  mushrooms  and  spent  mushroom  substrate  can  be  converted  into organic manure and vermi-compost. Mushrooms are grown seasonally as well as in state-ofart  environment  controlled  cropping  rooms  all  the  year  round  in  the  commercial  units. Mushroom  growing  is  a  highly  labour  oriented  venture  and  labour  availability  is  no constraint in the country and two factors, that is, availabilities of raw materials and labour make  mushroom  growing  economically  profitable  in  India.  Moreover,  scope  for  intense diversification  by  cultivation  of  other  edible  mushrooms  like  oyster,  shiitake,  milky  and other medicinal mushrooms are additional opportunities for Indian growers.

At  present,  four  mushrooms viz. , Button  mushroom  ( Agaricus  bisporus ), Oyster Mushroom ( Pleurotus spp), Paddy straw mushroom ( Volvariella spp.) and Milky mushroom ( Calocybe indica ) have been recommended for round the year cultivation in India.

India  produces  about  600  million  tonnes  of  agricultural  by  products,  which  can profitably  be  utilized  for  the  cultivation  of  mushrooms.  Currently,  we  are  using  0.04%  of these residues for producing around 1.29 lakh tons of mushrooms of which 85% is button mushroom. India  contributes  about  3%  of  the  total  world  button  mushroom  production. Even if we use 1% of the residues for mushroom production, we can produce 3.0 million tons  of  mushrooms,  which  will  be  almost  equal  to  current  global  button  mushroom production  (current  world  production  3.4  million  tons).  To  remain  competitive  it  will  be important  to  harness  science  and  modern  technologies  for  solving  the  problems  of production  and  bio-risk  management.  Mushroom  being  an  indoor  crop,  utilizing  vertical space offers a solution to shrinking land and better water utility.

Mushrooms  have  been  reported  to  be  capable  of  transforming  agro  wastes  like paddy straw into  protein  rich  food  and  have  been  confirmed  to  be  sources  of  single  cell protein. Mushrooms contain rich source of carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids and dietary fibre.  Vitamins  such  as  riboflavin,  niacin  and  pantothenic  acid,  and  the  essential  minerals selenium, copper and potassium are abundant in mushrooms. The foremost importance is that mushrooms do not have cholesterol, instead contain ergosterol that act as a precursor for  vitamin  D  synthesis  in  human  body.  Mushrooms  are  believed  to  help  fight  against cancer, relieves hypertension, imparts protection from heart diseases. Mushroom crop is in fact  a  boon  that  can  solve  several  problems  like  the  protein  malnutrition,  unemployment issues and environmental pollution.

Mushrooms are cultivated indoors and do not require arable land and mushroom is a short duration crop with high yield per unit  time. For small farmers and landless workers mushroom cultivation is highly suitable for the economic and social security of this group. This hi-tech horticulture venture relieves the pressure on arable land, because it cultivation is indoors,  and  is  also  more  suited  to  the  women  folk.  Mushrooms  supplement  and complement  the  nutritional  deficiencies  and  are  regarded  as  the  highest  producers  of protein  per  unit  area  and  almost  100  times  more  than  the  conventional  agriculture  and animal husbandry.

At  present,  in  Tamil  Nadu  the  annual  production  of  mushroom  is  around  11,000 tonnes, button mushroom accounts for 7,500 tonnes, Oyster mushroom accounts for 2700 tonnes and milky mushroom contributes for 800 tonnes. During the past two decades, the Mushroom Research and Training Centre of the Department of Plant Pathology, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore has made tremendous efforts on transfer of mushroom cultivation  technology  by  imparting  trainings.  By  this  way  it  has  contributed  for  the establishment of about 50 spawn producers and 600 oyster mushroom growers  accounting for 7- 8 tonnes / day, 50 button mushroom growers producing 18-20 tonnes / day and 35 milky  mushroom  growers  contributing  1-2  tonnes  /  day  in  Tamil  Nadu.  This  account  for around 8 per cent of total mushroom production of the country.

## Mushroom Cultivation techniques for Oyster and Milk mushroom Base culture/ Nucleus culture

Tissue  culture  technique  is  used  to  bring  the  edible  mushroom  to  pure  culture  so that  the  mushroom  fungus  can  further  be  used  to  prepare  spawn.  Which  is  an  essential material for mushroom cultivation.

- · This nucleus culture is grown on Potato Dextrose Agar medium in test tubes.

- · A  small  tissue  from  a  well-grown  mushroom  is  aseptically  transferred  to  agar medium in a test tube in a culture room.
- · The  test  tubes  are  incubated  under  room  temperature  for  10  days  for  full  white growth of fungal cultue. This is called base  culture/nucleus culture and further used for preparation of Mother Spawn.

## Mother spawn

Mother spawn is nothing but the mushroom fungus grown on a grain based medium. Among the several substrate materials tested by TNAU, Coimbatore, sorghum grains are the best substrate for excellent growth of the fungus. Well-filled, disease-free sorghum grains are  used  as  substrate  for  growing  the  spawn  materials.  The  various  steps  involving  in preparation of mother spawn are listed below here under.

- · The sorghum grains are washed in water thoroughly to remove chaffy and damaged grains.
- · The grains are half cooked in an autoclave / vessel for 30 minutes to soften them.
- · The half cooked grains are spread evenly over hessian cloth on a platform to remove the excess water.
- · Calcium carbonate is mixed thoroughly with the cooked, dried grains@ 20g/Kg.
- · The grains are filled inn polypropylene bags up to 3/4 th height (approximately 300330 g/bag).
- · A one inch diameter PVP ring is inserted on open end of the bag and plugged with non-absorbent cotton wood.
- · The bags are arranged inside an autoclave and sterilized under 20-lbs,pressure for 2 hours.
- · The bags after cooling are kept inside the culture room under the UV light for 20 min.
- · After 20 minutes the UV light is put off and the fungal culture is transferred in to the sterilized cholam bags.
- · The  inoculated  bags  are  kept  in  a  clean  room  under  temperature  for  10  days  for further preparation of bed spawn.

## Bed Spawn

The method of preparation of bed spawn was same as that of mother spawn. The cooking, filling and sterilization were similar to that of mother spawn. After sterilization, the bags are taken and the fully grown mother spawn is used for inoculation to prepare bed spawn. Thirty bed spawn can be prepared from a single mother spawn. The bags are incubated at room temperature (27±2 C) for 10 days and used as bed spawn. ˚

## Cultivation of Oyster mushroom

The oyster mushrooms  can  be grown indoors in cropping house where a temperature of 25-30 o C and relative humidity of 80-85 per cent can be maintained.

- · Paddy straw is used as the raw substrate which has to be soaked in water for 4 hours and boiled or steamed in autoclave for 45 minutes and shade dried until 65-70% moisture.
- · Cylindrical beds are prepared using 60x30 cm polythene bags with a thickness of 80 gauge.

- · Paddy straw and spawn are filled as alternate layers in polythene bags and 10-12 holes are made in the beds.
- · The  bags  are  placed  in  the  cropping  house/shed    in  racks  or  in  hanging  rope system. After 15-16 days when the paddy straws in the bags are covered with white mycelia growth, pinheads start emerging where water spray is essential to prevent drying of buds.
- · First harvest begins from 3-4 days after in head emergence and likewise at 5-7 days internal three harvests can be done.
- · Total cropping cycle is around 40-45 days.
- · The average bio efficiency ranges (100-150 per cent) depending on the variety.

## Cultivation of Milky mushroom

The milky mushroom requires a temperature of 30-35 C and relative humidity of 85-˚ 90 per cent. For cultivation of this mushroom two shed are needed.

- · Thatched shed / cropping house  (28±2 C).for Spawn running ˚
- · A sunken blue poly house (For Cropping)
- · Three  feet  deep  pit  is  dug  out  and  sides  are  lined  with  hollow  blocks  and semicircular  structure  is  built  with  GI  pipe  of  Langley  and  covered  with  Blue silpaulin sheet.
- · Paddy straw is processed as in oyster mushroom cultivation and cylindrical beds are  prepared  with  90x30  cm  polythene  bags  and  stored  at  30 o C  in  thatched sheds (spawn running room).
- · After  18-20  days  when  the  paddy  straws  in  the  bags  are  covered  with  white mycelial  growth,  the  beds  are  cut  in  to  two  halves  and  casing  soil  (autoclaved garden  soil)  is  layered  on  to  the  cut  halves  for  2  cm  height  and  sprayed  with water.
- · The  cased  beds  are  placed  in  poly  houses  and  the  required  tem  premature  is maintained.
- · The pinheads emerge from the cut halves over the casing soil on 25-26 th day.
- · First  harvest  begins  on  28 th day  and  likewise  three-  five  harvests  can  be  done. The total cropping cycle is around 45-50 days. The average bio efficiency ranges from 150-160 per cent.

## 13. COMPOSTING AND INDUSTRIAL WASTE WATER UTILIZATION

## I. CROP RESIDUE COMPOSTING

Crop residues are the plant parts that are left in the field after harvest. The harvest refuses include straws, stubble, stover and haulms of different crops.  Crop remains are also from thrashing  sheds  or  that  are  discarded  during  crop  processing.  This  includes  process wastes like groundnut shell, oil cakes, rice husks and cobs of maize, sorghum and cumbu. The  greatest  potential  as  a  biomass  resource  appears  to  be  from  the  field  residues  of sorghum,  maize,  soybean,  cotton,  sugarcane  etc.  In  Tamil  Nadu  190  lakh  tonnes  of  crop residues are available for use. These residues will contribute 1.0 lakh ton of nitrogen, 0.5 lakh  ton  of  phosphorus  and  2.0  lakh  tons  of  potassium.  However  crop  residues  need composting before being used as manure.

## Waste collection

Crop residues accumulated in different locations are to be brought to compost yard. The compost yard should be located in anyone corner of the farm with accessibility via good road. Water resource should also be available in sufficient quantity. The crop residues that are brought to compost yard should be heaped in one corner for further processing.

## Shredding of waste materials

Particle  size  is  one  of  the  factor  that  influence  the  composting.  It  is  advisable  to shred all the crop residues that are used for composting. Shredding the waste manually is labour intensive. Shredder machine can be employed to shred all the crop residue biomass. Particle size of 5 cm is recommended for quick composting.

## Mixing of green waste and brown waste

Carbon and nitrogen ratio decides the initiation of composting process. If C:N ratio is wide  (100:1)  composting  will  not  take  place.  Narrow  C:N  ratio  of  30:1  is  ideal  for composting. To get a narrow C:N ratio, carbon and nitrogen rich material should be mixed together. Green  coloured  waste  materials  like glyricidia leaves, parthenium,  freshly harvested  weeds,  sesbania  leaves  are  rich  in  nitrogen,  whereas  brown  coloured  waste material  like  straw,  coir  dust,  dried  leaves  and  dried  grasses  are  rich  in  carbon.  In  any composting  process  these  carbon  and  nitrogen  rich  material  is  to  be  mixed  together  to make the composting quicker rather than putting green waste alone or brown color waste alone for composting. Animal dung is also a good source of nitrogen. While making heap formation, alternative layers of carbon rich material, animal dung and nitrogen rich material are to be heaped to get a quicker result in composting.

## Compost heap formation

Minimum 4 feet height should be maintained for composting. The composting area should  be  elevated  one  and  have  sufficient  shade.  While  heap  formation,  all  the  crop residues should be mixed together to form a heterogeneous material rather than a single homogenous  material. Alternate layers of carbon and nitrogen rich material with intermittent layers of animal dung are essential. After heap formation the material should be thoroughly moistened.

## Bioinputs for composting

TNAU Biomineralizer consortium contains groups of microorganisms, which accelerate  the  composting  process.  If  this  inoculum  is  not  added  to  the  composting material,  natural  microorganisms  establish  on  the  waste  material  on  its  own  and  do  the composting work. This process takes longtime. But if external source of inoculum is added, the microbial activity starts earlier and composting period will be reduced.

For one tonne of crop wastes 2 kg of TNAU Biomineralizer is recommended. This two kg  Biomineralizer  should  be  mixed  with  20  liters  of  water  and  made  slurry.  When  the compost heap is formed in between layers the slurry should be inoculated, so that it mixes with  the  waste  material  thoroughly  for  uniform  coating  of  microorganism  on  the  waste material.  Cow  dung  slurry  is  also  a  good  source  for  microbial  inoculum.  But  it  carries unwanted microorganisms also which may compete with composting organism. But when TNAU Biomineralizer is not available, cow dung slurry is a good source material. For one tonne of crop residues 40 kg fresh cow dung is required. This 40 kg fresh cow dung is mixed with 100 litres of water and it should be thoroughly poured over the waste material. Cow dung slurry acts as nitrogen source as well as source of microbial inoculum.

## Aerating the compost material

Sufficient quantity of oxygen should be available inside the compost heap. For this external air should be freely get in and comes out of the material. Normally to allow the fresh  air  to  get  inside,  the  compost  heap  should  be  turned  upside  down,  once  in  fifteen days. In this process top layer comes to bottom and bottom layer goes to top. This process also  activates  the  microbial  process  and  compost  process  is  hastened.  In  some  cases  air ventilating pipe maybe inserted vertically and horizontally, to allow the air to pass through. The wood chip that is available as waste in wood processing industry may also be used as bulking  agent  in  the  composting  process.  This  bulking  agent  gives  more  air  space  to  the compost material.

## Moisture maintenance

Throughout  the  composting  period  60%  moisture  should  be  maintained.  On  any situation, compost material should not be allowed to dry. If the material becomes dry, all the  microorganisms  present  in  the  crop  residues  will  die  and  the  compost  process  gets affected.

## Compost maturity

Volume reduction,  black  colour,  earthy  odor,  reduction  in  particle  size  are  all  the physical  factors  to  be  observed  for  compost  maturity.  After  satisfying  with  the  compost maturity index, the compost heap can be disturbed and spread on the floor for curing. After curing for one day, the composted material is sieved through 4 mm sieve to get uniform composted material. The residues collected after composting has to be again composted to finish the composting process.

## Compost enrichment

The harvested compost should be heaped in a shade, preferably on a hard floor. The beneficial microorganisms like Azotobacter or, Azospirillum, Pseudomonas, Phosphobacteria (0.2%) and rock phosphate (2%) have to be inoculated for one ton of compost. Forty per cent moisture should be maintained for the maximum growth of inoculated microorganism.

This  incubation  should  be  allowed  for  20  days  for  the  organism  to  reach  the  maximum population.  Now  the  compost  is  called  as  enriched  compost.  The  advantage  of  enriched compost overnormal compost is the quality manure with higher nutrient status with high number of beneficial microorganisms and plant growth promoting substances.

## Nutritive value of Biocompost

The  nutritive  value  of  biocompost  varies  from  lot  to  lot  because  of  varying  input materials. But in general biocompost contains all the macro and micro nutrients required for crops, which is given in the following table.  Even though the quantity available is low it covers all the requirements of the crop.

## Benefits of biocompost

- · Quality  and  enriched  manure  from  the  crop  and  animal  residues  available  in  the farm. The manure contains both nutrients and beneficial microorganisms.
- · There is improvement in the physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil due to regular addition of biocompost.
- · Quality  products  will  be  obtained  from  the  crop  due  to  improvement  in  the  soil fertility status.
- · Soil  organic  matter  content  increased  and  soil  biodiversity  also  improved  due  to enhanced soil organic matter content.

## Compost application

Organic  manures  are  highly  regarded  as  good  source  of  material  to  maintain  soil health and increasing soil organic carbon content. Organic manures cannot be equated with inorganic fertilizers. But organic manures deliver all the nutrients to the soil but with little quantity. For one hectare of land 5 tons of enriched biocompost is recommended. It can be used as basal application in the field before taking up planting work.

## Limitation in biocompost application

- · While  preparing  the  biocompost,  it should  be  ensured  that the material is composted thoroughly.
- · If  the  materials  are  not  fully  composted,  the  material  should  be  sieved  through  4 mm sieve and sieved material will be taken as well as composted one. The residues will be put back for another round of composting.
- · It is better avoid woody material like heavy branches from pruned trees and other wooden materials.  It  will  take  long  time  and  it  interferes  with  other  material  for composting.

## II. ENRICHED ORGANIC MANURE FROM COIR DUST

Enriched organic manure from coir dust is nutrient rich organic manure obtained by composting coir dust along with poultry manure, rock phosphate and microbial inoculants Pleurotus sajor-caju , Bacillus sp, Trichoderma sp and Pseudomonas sp. This is a simple and rapid technique to compost coir dust within 60 days.

## Inputs

Coir dust

:

1tonne

Poultry manure :

200 kg

Rock phosphate :

10 kg

Pleurotussajor-caju

:

2kg

Microbial inoculants   :

2kg

( Bacillus sp + Trichoderma sp + Pseudomonas sp)

## Methodology

A partially shaded area should be selected for composting of coir dust. The floor of the selected area must be hard to prevent leaching of water or nutrients from the compost. Spread  one  tonne  of  coir  dust  over  the  floor  selected  for  composting.  A  hard-cemented surface is ideal for composting. Otherwise the floor should be hardened by putting stones and other hardy materials. Poultry manure (200 kg) and rock phosphate (10 kg), Pleurotus sajor caju (2 kg), microbial  inoculums  (2  kg)  consists  of Bacillus, Trichoderma, and Pseudomonas are  added  to  the  coir  dust.  All  the  above  materials  are  mixed  together thoroughly with one tonne of coir dust. After thorough mixing it should be sprinkled with water  and  formed  in  to  a  heap.  The  moisture  level  should  be  maintained  at  60%  level through  out  the  composting  period.  However  water  should  not  be  dripped  out  of  the composting material. For uniform composting of coir dust, the compost should be turned once in every 10 days. There will be reduction in volume of coir dust and all the material will be  changed  to  black  in  color  after  60 th day  with  an  earthy  odor  from  the  composted material. It will have high water holding capacity. The enriched coir dust compost contains the following nutrients.

## III. COMPOSTING OF POULTRY WASTES

## Value addition of Poultry Waste through Composting technology

Poultry  industry  is  one  of  the  largest  and  fastest  growing  livestock  production systems in the world. In India, there are about 3430 million populations of poultry with a waste generation of 3.30 million tonnes per year. The localized nature of poultry production also  means that it can represent a large percentage of the agricultural economy in many states  or  regions.  Although  economical  and  successful,  the  poultry  industry  is  currently facing with a number of highly complex and challenging environmental problems, many of which are related to its size and geographically concentrated nature. From an agricultural perspective, poultry wastes play a major role in the contamination of ground water through nitrate nitrogen. Also, the eutrophication of surface water due to phosphorus, pesticides, heavy metals and pathogens present in the poultry wastes applied to soils are the central environmental issues at the present time.

Among the animal manures, poultry droppings have higher nutrient contents. It has nitrogen (4.55 to 5.46 %), phosphorus (2.46 to 2.82 %), potassium (2.02 to 2.32 %), calcium (4.52 to 8.15 %), magnesium (0.52 to 0.73 %) and appreciable quantities of micronutrients like Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn etc. In addition to this cellulose (2.26 to 3.62%), hermicellulose (1.89 to 2.77 %) and lignin (1.07 to 2.16 %) are also present in poultry waste. These components upon microbial action can be converted to value added compost with high nutrient status. In poultry droppings, nearly 60% of nitrogen which is present as uric acid and urea is lost through ammonia volatilization by hydrolysis. This loss of nitrogen reduces the agronomic value of the product, besides causing atmospheric pollution. Composting with amendment seems promising in conservation of nitrogen in poultry droppings. Nitrogen in poultry waste can  be  effectively conserved  by  composting  with  suitable  organic  amendment.  The technologies developed will be highly useful to the poultry farmers.

## Method of preparation of poultry waste compost using coir pith

## Inputs required

- · Poultry droppings
- · Coirpith
- · Pleurotus sajor-caju

## Method

A  known  quantity  of  the  poultry  waste  as  collected  above  along  with  coir  pith  is inoculated  with Pleurotus  sajor-caju @ 2  packets  per  tonne to speed  up  the  composting process.  This  mixer  should  be  placed  under  shade  as  heap.  The  moisture  content  of  the heap should be maintained at 50 to 60%. Periodical turning must be given on 21 st , 28 th and 35 th days of composting. Another two packets of Pleurotus sajor-caju is to be added during turning given on the 28 th day  of  composting. Good quality compost will be attained after 45 th day  of  composting.  The  nutrient  contents  of  the  composts  of  poultry  litter  collected from caged system and deep litter systems are as below;

| Nutrient content   | Nutrient content   |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Nitrogen (%)       | 2.08 - 2.13        |
| Phosphorous (%)    | 2.40 -2.61         |
| Potassium (%)      | 2.03-2.94          |
| C:N ratio          | 13:1-14:1          |

## Points to be remembered

- · Elevated shady place is highly suitable.
- · Within  a  period  of  10  to  15  days,  the  temperature  of  the  heap  will  raise  to maximum. If the temperature drops below 50º C, the heaps should be spread and moistened with water to bring the moisture content to 60%.
- · Colour of the compost will turn from brown to black.
- · The matured compost will be odourless.
- · The volume of the compost heap will be reduced to 1/3.
- · Temperature of the heap will be same as the ambient air temperature and stable.
- · Matured compost will be light and fine textured.
- · Moisture content of the heap can be measured using moisture meter or by taking handful of compost from the heap and squeezing it with the fingers. If excess water drips out from the compost, then it is considered to have &gt;60 % moisture. If small quantity  of  water  oozes  out  as  drops,  then  moisture  content  is  considered  to  be optimum i.e ., 60%.
- · Each compost heap should have a minimum of one tonne to retain the heat for post decomposition.

## Value

Animal manures especially poultry manure are rich in N and the nutrient value of the manure is reduced by loss of N through ammonia volatilization and denitrification. Good quality  poultry  manure  can  be  obtained  by  mixing  the  poultry  waste  with  selective carbonaceous material such as coirpith and inoculation with suitable microorganism. It can be  used  as  an  eco-friendly  technique  for  the  conversion  of  poultry  waste  into  valuable compost.

## Benefits

Poultry wastes contain higher concentrations of nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus than wastes of other animal species and the presence of nutrients provides more incentive for  the  utilization  of  this  resource.  The  loss  of  nitrogen  from  poultry  droppings  can  be effectively conserved by composting with coir pith and serves as a good source of organic nutrients  to  agricultural  fields.  To  make  the  organic  nutrients  present  in  poultry  waste available to plants, the waste has to be composted suitably to minimize the volatilization of ammonia.

## Applications

The poultry waste compost will be a very good organic manure@6 ton / ha for all the crops.

## Limitations

The uninterrupted availability of the raw materials has to be ensured for continuous production on a commercial scale.

## IV. VERMICOMPOST

Earthworms live in the soil and feed on decaying organic material. After digestion, the undigested material moves through the alimentary canal of the earthworm, a thin layer of oil is deposited on the castings. This layer erodes over a period of 2 months. So although the plant nutrients are immediately available, they are slowly released to last longer. The process  in  the  alimentary  canal  of  the  earthworm  transforms  organic  waste  to  natural fertilizer.   The  chemical  changes  that  organic  wastes  undergo  include  deodorizing  and neutralizing.  This  means  that  the  pH  of  the  castings  is  7  (neutral)  and  the  castings  are odorless. The worm castings also contain bacteria, so the process is continued in the soil, and microbiological activity is promoted.

Vermicomposting is  the  process  of  turning  organic  debris  into  worm  castings.  The worm  castings  are  very  important  to  the  fertility  of  the  soil.  The  castings  contain  high amounts of nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium. Castings contain: 5 times the available nitrogen, 7 times the available potash, and 1 ½ times more calcium than found  in  good  top  soil.  Several  researchers  have  demonstrated  that  earthworm  castings have excellent aeration, porosity, structure, drainage, and moisture-holding capacity. The content of the earthworm castings, along with the natural tillage by the worms burrowing action, enhances the permeability of water in the soil.  Worm castings can hold close to nine times their weight in water. 'Vermiconversion,' or using earthworms to convert waste into soil additives, has been done on a relatively small scale for some time. A recommended rate of vermicompost application is 15-20 per cent. Vermicomposting is done on small and large scales.

## Materials for preparation of Vermicompost

Any types of biodegradable wastes can be used for vermicomposting

- 1. Crop residues
- 2. Weed biomass
- 3. Vegetable waste
- 4. Leaf litter
- 5. Hotel refuse
- 6. Waste from agro-industries
- 7. Biodegradable portion of urban and rural wastes

## PHASE OF VERMICOMPOSTING

Phase 1 :

Processing involving collection of wastes, shredding, mechanical separation  of  the  metal,  glass  and  ceramics  and  storage  of organic wastes.

Phase 2 :

Pre  digestion  of  organic  waste  for  twenty  days  by  heaping  the material  along  with  cattle  dung  slurry.   This  process  partially digests the material and fit for earthworm consumption.  Cattle dung  and  biogas  slurry  may  be  used  after  drying.   Wet  dung should not be used for vermicompost production.

Phase 3 :

Preparation  of  earthworm  bed.  A  concrete  base  is  required  to put  the  waste  for  vermicompost  preparation.   Loose  soil  will allow the worms to go into soil and also while watering, all the dissolvable nutrients go into the soil along with water.

Phase 4 :

Collection of earthworm after vermicompost collection.  Sieving the  composted  material  to  separate  fully  composted  material. The partially composted material will be again put into vermicompost bed.

Phase 5 :

Storing the vermicompost in proper place to maintain moisture and allow the beneficial microorganisms to grow.

## Bedding

Bedding is any material that provides the worms with a relatively stable habitat. This habitat must have the following characteristics:

## High absorbency

Worms breathe through their skins and therefore must have a moist environment in which to live. If a worm's skin dries out, it dies. The bedding must be able to absorb and retain water fairly well if the worms are to thrive.

## Good bulking potential

If the material is too dense to begin with, or packs too tightly, then the flow of air is reduced  or  eliminated.  Worms  require  oxygen  to  live,  just  as  we  do.  Different  materials affect the overall porosity of the bedding through a variety of factors, including the range of particle size and shape, the texture, and the strength and rigidity of its structure. The overall effect is referred to in this document as the material's bulking potential.

## Low protein and/or nitrogen content (high Carbon: Nitrogen ratio)

Although  the  worms  do  consume  their  bedding  as  it  breaks  down,  it  is  very important  that  this  be  a  slow  process.  High  protein/nitrogen  levels  can  result  in  rapid degradation  and  its  associated  heating,  creating  inhospitable,  often  fatal,  conditions. Heating can occur safely in the food layers of the vermiculture or vermicomposting system, but not in the bedding.

## VERMICOMPOST PRODUCTION METHODOLOGY i) Selection of suitable earthworm

For vermicompost production, the surface dwelling earthworm alone should be used. The earthworm, which lives below the soil, is not suitable for vermicompost production.  The African earthworm ( Eudrillus engeniae), Red worms ( Eisenia foetida) and composting worm ( Peronyx excavatus) are promising worms used for vermicompost production. All the three worms can be mixed together for vermicompost production. The African worm ( Eudrillus eugeniae) is  preferred  over  other  two  types,  because  it  produces  higher  production  of vermicompost in short period of time and more young ones in the composting period.

## ii) Selection of site for vermicompost production

Vermicompost can be produced in any place with shade, high humidity and cool. Abandoned  cattle  shed  or  poultry  shed  or  unused  buildings  can  be  used.   If  it  is  to  be produced in open area, shady place is selected.  A thatched roof may be provided to protect the process from direct sunlight and rain. The waste heaped for vermicompost production should be covered with moist gunny bags.

## iii) Containers for vermicompost production

A cement tub may be constructed to a height of 2½ feet and a breadth of 3 feet. The

length may be fixed to any level depending upon the size of the room.  The bottom of the tub  is  made  to  slope  like  structure  to  drain  the  excess  water  from  vermicompost  unit.  A small sump is necessary to collect the drain water.In another option over the hand floor, hollow blocks / bricks may be arranged in compartment to a height of one feet, breadth of 3 feet  and  length  to  a  desired  level  to  have  quick  harvest.  In  this  method,  moisture assessment will be very easy.  No excess water will be drained. Vermicompost can also be prepared in  wooden boxes, plastic  buckets  or  in  any  containers  with  a  drain  hole  at  the bottom.

## iv) Vermiculture bed

Vermiculture bed or worm bed (3 cm) can be prepared by placing after saw dust or husk or coir waste or sugarcane trash in the bottom of tub / container. A layer of fine sand (3 cm) should be spread over the culture bed followed by a layer of garden soil (3 cm).  All layers must be moistened with water.

## v) Worm Food

Compost worms are big eaters. Under ideal conditions, they are able to consume in excess of their body weight each day, although the general rule-of-thumb is ½ of their body weight per day. They will eat almost anything organic (that is, of plant or animal origin), but they definitely prefer some foods to others. Manures are the most commonly used worm feedstock,  with  dairy  and  beef  manures  generally  considered  the  best  natural  food  for Eisenia , with  the  possible  exception  of  rabbit  manure.  The  former,  being  more  often available in large quantities, is the feed most often used.

## vi) Selection for vermicompost production

Cattle  dung  (except  pig,  poultry  and  goat),  farm  wastes,  crop  residues,  vegetable market waste, flower market waste, agro industrial waste, fruit market waste and all other bio degradable waste are suitable for vermicompost production.  The cattle dung should be dried in open sunlight before used for vermicompost production.  All other waste should be predigested with cow dung for twenty days before put into vermibed for composting.

## vii) Putting the waste in the container

The  predigested  waste  material  should  be  mud  with  30%  cattle  dung  either  by weight  or  volume.  The  mixed  waste  is  placed  into  the  tub  /  container  upto  brim.  The moisture level should be maintained at 60%. Over this material, the selected earthworm is placed uniformly. For one-meter length, one-meter breadth and 0.5-meter height, 1 kg of worm (1000 Nos.) is required. There is no necessity that earthworm should be put inside the waste. Earthworm will move inside on its own.

## viii) Watering the vermibed

Daily watering is not required for vermibed. But 60% moisture should be maintained throughout the period.  If necessity arises, water should be sprinkled over the bed rather than pouring the water. Watering should be stopped before the harvest of vermicompost.

## ix) Harvesting vermicompost

In the tub method of composting, the castings formed on the top layer are collected periodically. The collection may be carried out once in a week.  With hand the casting will be scooped out and put in a shady place as heap like structure.  The harvesting of casting should  be  limited  up  to  earthworm  presence  on  top  layer.   This  periodical  harvesting  is necessary for free flow and retain the compost quality. Otherwise the finished compost get compacted  when  watering  is  done.  In  small  bed  type  of  vermicomposting  method, periodical  harvesting  is  not  required.   Since  the  height  of  the  waste  material  heaped  is around 1 foot, the produced vermicompost will be harvested after the process is over.

## x) Harvesting earthworm

After the vermicompost production, the earthworm present in the tub / small bed may be harvested by trapping method.  In the vermibed, before harvesting the compost, small, fresh cow dung ball is made and inserted inside the bed in five or six places. After 24 hours, the cow dung ball is removed. All the worms will be adhered into the ball.  Putting the  cow  dung  ball  in  a  bucket  of  water  will  separate  this  adhered  worm.   The  collected worms will be used for next batch of composting.

## xi) Nutritive value of vermicompost

The nutrients content in vermicompost vary depending on the waste materials that is being used for compost preparation. If the waste materials are heterogeneous one, there will  be  wide  range  of  nutrients  available  in  the  compost.  If  the  waste  materials  are homogenous one, there will be only certain nutrients are available. The common available nutrients in vermicompost is as follows

Organic carbon :

9.5 - 17.98%

Nitrogen :

0.5 - 1.50%

Phosphorous

:

0.1 - 0.30%

Potassium

:

0.15 - 0.56%

Sodium :

0.06 - 0.30%

Calcium and Magnesium :

22.67 to 47.60 meq/100g

Copper :

2 - 9.50 mg kg-1

Iron :

2 - 9.30 mg kg-1

Zinc :

5.70 - 11.50 mg kg-1

Sulphur :

128 - 548 mg kg-1

## xii) Storing and packing of vermicompost

The  harvested  vermicompost  should  be  stored  in  dark,  cool  place.  It  should  have minimum 40% moisture. Sunlight should not fall over the composted material.  It will lead to  loss  of  moisture  and  nutrient  content.  It  is  advocated  that  the  harvested  composted material is openly stored rather than packed in over sac. Packing can be done at the time of selling. If it is stored in open place, periodical sprinkling of water may be done to maintain

moisture level and also to maintain beneficial microbial population. If the necessity comes to store the material, laminated over sac is used for packing. This will minimize the moisture evaporation loss. Vermicompost can be stored for one year without loss of its quality, if the moisture is maintained at 40% level.

## 4. Advantages of vermicompost

- · Vermicompost is rich in all essential plant nutrients.
- · Provides  excellent  effect  on  overall  plant  growth,  encourages  the  growth  of  new shoots / leaves and improves the quality and shelf life of the produce.
- · Vermicompost is free flowing, easy to apply, handle and store and does not have bad odour.
- · It improves soil structure, texture, aeration, and waterholding capacity and prevents soil erosion.
- · Vermicompost  is  rich  in  beneficial  micro  flora  such  as  a  fixers,  P-  solubilizers, cellulose decomposing micro-flora etc in addition to improve soil environment.
- · Vermicompost  contains  earthworm  cocoons  and  increases  the  population  and activity of earthworm in the soil.
- · It neutralizes the soil protection.
- · It prevents nutrient losses and increases the use efficiency of chemical fertilizers.
- · Vermicompost is free from pathogens, toxic elements, weed seeds etc.
- · Vermicompost minimizes the incidence of pest and diseases.
- · It enhances the decomposition of organic matter in soil.
- · It contains valuable vitamins, enzymes and hormones like auxins, gibberellins etc.

## 5. Pests and diseases of vermicompost

Compost worms are not subject to diseases caused by micro-organisms, but they are subject  to  predation  by  certain  animals  and  insects  (red  mites  are  the  worst)  and  to  a disease known as 'sour crop' caused by environmental conditions.

## INDUSTRIAL WASTE UTILIZATION FOR LAND RECLAMATION AND CROP PRODUCTION

## Application of Untreated Distillery Effluent (Spentwash) for the Reclamation of Sodic Soils

Amendments generally used to reclaim sodic soils are gypsum, phosphogypsum, iron pyrites  and  elemental  sulphur.  All  these  are  inorganic  in  nature.  Some  of  the  organic amendments to reclaim  the sodic soils are press-mud, farmyard manure (FYM), coir dust and  green  manures.  The  direct  discharge  of  untreated  distillery  effluent  (spentwash)  to reclaim  and  improve  the    productivity    of    the  sodic  soils  is  now  advocated.  Untreated distillery  effluent  (spentwash)  is  acidic  (pH:  3.8  -  4.2)  with  considerable  quantity  of potassium,  calcium  and  magnesium  and  traces  of  micronutrients.  Organic  compounds, mainly the humic related melanoidins improve  the bio-catalytic  potential  of the treated soil.

Hence, only one time application of 3.75 to 5.00 lakhs litres of untreated distillery effluent (spentwash) per hectare of sodic soils in summer months is recommended. Natural oxidation can be induced for a period of six weeks with two  intermittent  dry ploughing  at a  particular    interval.    Then,  after  45  -  60 th day  of  application,  soil  is  to  be  irrigated  with

fresh  water  and  drained.  This  treatment  reduces  the  pH  and  exchangeable  sodium percentage  to normal  level and increases  the productivity  of the sodic soils. After this reclamation  practice,  rice  crop  can  be  raised  in  the  effluent  applied  field  adopting  the conventional  cultivation  technique.  Application  of  this  effluent  again  to    the    next crop/season or year after year and also to the land nearby drinking water sources  is not advocated.

## Application of Treated Distillery Effluent to Crops

- · Treated  distillery  effluent  contains  nitrogen 1200 mg L -1 , phosphate 500 mg L , -1 potash 12000 mg L , calcium 1800 mg L -1 -1 and iron 300 mg L -1 . Since the effluent  has  higher dissolved  salts,  50  times  diluted  effluent  can  be  irrigated  to  sugarcane,    banana, ragi, sunflower, grasses, cotton and soybean.
- · It can also be used as one time application  to fallow land at the rate 20,000  to 40, 000 litres   per hectare. It should be allowed for complete drying over a period of 20 to 30 days. The  effluent applied field is to be thoroughly ploughed two times for the natural  oxidation  and  mineralization  of  organic  matter.  After  that,  crops  can  be raised in the effluent applied field adopting the conventional methods.  Application of this effluent again to the next crop/season  or year after year and also to the land nearby drinking water sources is not advocated.

## Irrigation of Pulp and Paper Mill Effluents

Pulp  and  paper  effluents  contain  lot of dissolved  solids  and stabilized  organic matter. The properly treated effluent with EC less than 1.2 dSm -1 as such can safely be used for  irrigation  with  appropriate  amendments viz., pressmud @ 5 tonnes ha -1 (or)  fortified pressmud @ 2.5 tonnes ha -1 or daincha as in -situ green manure (6.25 tonnes ha -1 ).

Though there were perceptible changes in soil pH, EC, available NPK, exchangeable cations, exchangeable sodium per cent and sodium absorption ratio, there is no detrimental effect  due  to sodium either on soil or plants grown in sandy loam soils with good drainage facilities. This treated effluent can be used for irrigation in these soils for the following crops and varieties along with recommended doses of amendments viz., pressmud @ 5 tonnes ha -1 , or fortified pressmud @ 2.5 tonnes ha -1 or daincha as in situ green manure (6.25 tonnes ha -1 ).

| Crops     |    | Varieties                                  |
|-----------|----|--------------------------------------------|
| Rice      | :  | IR 20, TRY 1, CO 43.                       |
| Maize     | :  | CO 1                                       |
| Sunflower | :  | CO 2                                       |
| Groundnut | :  | TMV 7                                      |
| Soybean   | :  | CO 1                                       |
| Sugarcane | :  | CO 6304,  COSi 86071, COC 95071,  CO 86032 |
| Tapioca   | :  | CO (TP) 4, CO 2, CO 3, MVD  1              |

However, irrigating  this  treated  effluent  to  oil  seed  crops  like  gingelly  and  castor, pulses like greengram and blackgram is not advocated as they were found to be sensitive for this type of effluent irrigation.

## Reclamation of papermill effluent irrigated soil

Application of 7.25 t ha -1 of  gypsum is recommended to reclaim the  TEWLIS  area soils    of  Karur  district  (Moolimangalam,  Pandipalayam,  Pazhamapuram,  Thadampalayam and Ponniagoundanpudur) where the treated paper mill effluent is being continuously used for  irrigation since 1995. Application of pressmud @ 6 t ha -1 along with Blue Green Algae (15 kg ha -1 ) and Gypsum (50% Gypsum requirement) is also effective in reclaiming the saline sodic  soil  with  continuous papermill effluent irrigation and to increase the green fodder yield of Lucerne.

New CSR breeds / hybrids require 15 to 20%  higher quantity of leaves.

- ** Note: The ratio between stem and leaves in the shoot ranges from 3:2 to 1:1. The shoots can be harvested and used accordingly for shoot rearing.

## 6. Chawki rearing and  cleaning:

In a tray of 120 cm x 90 cm x 10 cm size, 20 DFLs are brushed and reared till the end of second age.

- From brushing to the end of second age, the larvae are fed with tender leaves. The leaves are selected from the largest glossy leaf, 3 rd and 4 th from the top for I instar larvae. The 5 th to 8 th leaves are used to rear the second instar larvae. In the first age, one cleaning is given just a day before the worms settle for moult. In the second age, two cleanings are given, one after resumption of feeding and the

other a day before the second moult.

## 7. Shoot rearing for late age  worms

Provide separate rearing house for shoot rearing in shady areas.

Fabricate  the  rack  stand  with  wood  or  steel  and  the  rearing  seat  with  wire mesh/bamboo mat. Shoot rearing rack of 1.2m x 11m size is sufficient to rear 50 DFLs.

Provide 15cm border on all sides of the shelf to prevent the dispersal of the larvae.

Arrange the shelves in three tier system  with 50 cm space between  the tiers. Clean the bed once in each instar.

For cleaning, place two ropes parallelly  on the bed and place  the new shoots  over the ropes.  After all the worms have moved on to the new shoots, take the rope from the bed and remove the remains and refuses.

## 8. Shoot harvesting and feeding

Harvest the shoots at 1 m height from ground level at 60 to 70 days after pruning. Store the shoots vertically upwards in dark cooler room. Provide thin layer of water (3cm) in one corner  of storage  room and place the cut ends of shoots  in the water for moisture  retention.

Provide a layer  of newspaper  in rearing  shelf. Spread the shoot in perpendicular to

width of the bed.

Place  top  and  bottom  ends  of  the  shoots  alternatively  to  ensure  equal  mixing  of different qualities  of leaves.

Transfer the third instar larvae to shoots immediately after moulting.

Apply soya flour twice @ 5g / kg of shoots on first day of first feeding during  fourth and  fifth  instars during first  feeding.

## 9.   Pest and diseases  management

## Pest

## Uzi fly ( Exorista bombycis )

Provide physical barriers like wire mesh or nylon net in the doors and windows of the rearing rooms.

Spray uzicide (1 % benzoic acid) over the larvae to dislodge the eggs.

Dissolve 'uzi tables' in water ( 2 tablets /l) or Asiphor 15 ml/I of water in white bowls to attract the adults (uzitrap). Keep them near windows or at the entrance of rearing room.

Release hyperparasitiod, Nesolynx thymus @ 20,000 adults / 100 dfls. Spray uzifly ovo repellant @ 5 ml/ 5 litres on 3 rd , 4 th and 5 th instar larvae to ward off uzifly from laying eggs on silkworm larvae.

## SILKWORM DISEASES

General precautionary measures to be taken Proper disinfection of rearing room and appliances. Providing good ventillation

Maintenance of proper temperature and humidity in the rearing room or avoiding fluctuation in temperature and humidity conditions.

Feeding worms with good quality leaves.

Avoiding starvation.

Avoiding over crowding

Avoiding any damage to the skin of worms.

Proper disposal of the dead worms in 2 % bleaching powder + 0.3 % slaked lime solution.

Avoiding borrowing of mountages.

## 9.2.2. General bed disinfection

Keep the rearing bed thin and dry by applying slacked lime at 30 to 50 g/ m . 2

Apply bed disinfections such as Sakthi or Vijetha or Resham Jyothi or Sanjeevini  @ 4 kg/100 DFLs to prevent the secondary transmission of diseases.

Disinfection of rearing bed with bed disinfectants  at dose  of 4 kgs/100  dfls and are to be applied at 3g/sq. feet for chawki worms and 5g/sqfeet for late age  worms.

## 9.2.2. Viral/ Grasserie disease

Treat the mulberry leaves with aqueous leaf extract of Psoralea corylifolia or Plectranthus amboinicus at  0.1  %  or  1000  ppm  and  feed  to  the  worms  immediately  after  second  and third moult. Gentamycin 100 ppm is to be administered after fourth moult.

## Bacterial/Flacherie disease ( Streptococcus,Staphylococcus Bacillus, Serratia )

Treat  the  mulberry  leaves  with  aqueous  leaf  extract  of Aegle  marmelos or Thuja orientalis at  0.1%  or  1000  ppm  after  second  and  third  moult  and  500  ppm Streptomycin sulphate  after  fourth  moult.

## Fungal/Muscadine disease( Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium anisopliae, Aspergillus flavus )

10 g of dithane M 45 mixed with 1 kg of slaked lime is dusted over chawki worms at 3 g/sq  feet.  In  case  of  late  age  worms,  20  g  of  dithane  M  45  is  applied  at  5  g/  sq.feet. Disinfect rearing rooms and trays with 4% pentachlorophenol to control Aspergillosis.

## Pebrine ( Nosema bombycis )

This disease is taken care off in the grainages and only disease free eggs are supplied to farmers. If the disease is chance encountered in the rearing,  the  diseased  eggs,  larvae, pupae,  moths,  bed  refuses  and  faecal  pellets should  be  disposed  after thorough disinfection.  Storage  of leaves in a separate  room.

## 10.Moulting care

Apply slaked lime @ 30 to 50 g/m  when all the worms settle for moult for uniform 2 moulting. Dust 10 g dithane M 45 mixed with 1 Kg of slaked lime over chawki worms at 3 g/ sq. feet. In case of late age worms, 20 g of dithane M 45 is applied at 5 g/ sq. feet.

## 11.Mounting

- ¾ For early and uniform spinning of cocoons, apply Sampoorna @ 20 ml (dissolved in 4 litres of water) / 100 DFLs over the leaves and feed to silkworms.
- ¾ Spray the mulberry leaves with phytojuvenoid, Illamathi and feed to second day old fifth instar. Avoid hiring of mountages.
- ¾ Arrange 800 to 900 worms per m  on a mountage. 2
- ¾ Mountages should be kept in shade in a well ventilated place in slanting position during  spinning.  Rotary  mountages  can  also  be  used  (one  set  of  rotary  mountage can  accommodate  1560 worms).

## 12.Harvesting

Harvest the cocoons of crossbreeds and bivoltines on 5 th and 7 th day after spinning  respectively.

Cross breeds : Irrigated 50-60 kg/100 DFLs Bivoltines :

Rainfed 20-25 kg/100  DFLs 60-70 kg/100 DFLs

## 15. AGROFORESTRY

The present trend of growing trees in the farm lands demands for identification of economically potential tree species suitable to different climatic conditions  and  soil  types. The concept of agroforestry implies sustained, combined management of the same piece of land  for  silvicultural,  agricultural  and  pastural  crops  leading  to  an  overall  increase  of production compared to single crop management. This practice is of immense importance to our country  for it is intimately  linked with the question of increasing wood and food production  to  meet  the  needs  of  burgeoning  population  and  conservation  of  soil,  land ,moisture resources which is vital for the tropical regions. Properly distributed tree growth acts as a foster mother to agriculture.  This is particularly true in dry inhospitable climatic conditions.  Tree  growth  in  such  cases  conserves  soil  moisture,  increasing  atmospheric humidity, improves soil fertility, protects field crops against the scorching and desiccating effects  of  winds  and  generally  makes  the  climate  more  equable  and  pleasant,  thereby stepping up agricultural production.

The  silviculture  of  important  agroforestry  tree  species      viz., Eucalyptus  sp., Casuarina    spp,    Ailanthus excels a, Melia  dubia , Tectona  grandis,  Santalum  album  , Pterocarpus  santalinus,  Neolamarckia  cadamba and Leucaena  leucocephala are  given hereunder .

rich nutritious fodder for sheep and goats and are said to augment milk production.

The stem and branches are used for fuel wood but it gives poor quality fuel as it burns quickly and does not sustain heat for long.

The tree is the most adaptable and pollution tolerant. It  is  suitable  for  sloppy,  degraded and denuded areas and wasteland.

It is also yields gum of inferior quality.

The  bitter  and  aromatic  leaves  of  the  plant  show medicinal properties.

The leaves are used for the preparation of lotions for scabies.

Quassinoids and ailantic acid are isolated from bark. The dried bark is aromatic and burnt as incense.

## MASS MULTIPLICATION OF BAMBOOS USING ENTIRE CULM

Bamboos  are  the  versatile  trees,  which  flowers  only  once  in  its  life  cycle  (40-60 years) and dies what is popularly known as parthenogenesis. Hence, seed availability is very less at the same  time  the  seeds  are  less  viable.  This difficulty promoted  bamboo propagation  through  two  nodal  culm  cutting  with  rooting  hormone  treatment.  This conventional  technique  accounts  only  less  than  25  percent  success  rate.  The  present technology  is  developed  using  entire  culm  without  rooting  hormone  treatment  and achieved 90 percent rooting.

Remove one year old culm from the matured mother clump at 5-10 years growth stage.  Care  should  be  taken  to  remove  the  culm  without  damaging  the  culm  as  well  as mother clump. The removed culm should be delimbed carefully by leaving growing buds in the nodes. Then, the culm should be placed it in the raised nursery bed and covered with loose soil and sand mixture for half inch thickness. After providing adequate shade to the culms in the nursery bed with coconut sheaths or rice straw, watering should be done to field  capacity.  Watering  twice  a  day  should  be  continued  and  shoot  emergence  will  be observed after one month from all buds present in all nodes of the entire culm. Continue watering up to three months. The root emergence could be observed in 2-3 months. After rooting, the rooted culm should be removed entirely from the soil without any damage. To facilitate  uprooting  the  rooted  culms  without  damage,  watering  should  be  done.  Each rooted node with shoots should be separated with small hand saw. The separated cutting can be transferred to poly bag.

## MINI CLONAL PROPAGATION FOR TREE CROPS

A mini clonal technology has been developed for casuarinas and Melia which is one of the pioneering attempts in the country for these industrial wood species. Under this technology, the superior clonal plants were planted in a mini clonal garden and are provided with regular irrigation and fertilization in order to enhance shoot multiplication. In this method, the mother plants are planted at 10 cm x 10 cm spacing and 60 days old plants are ready for collection of cuttings.

## Clonal Garden establishment

The clonal garden can be established at a size of 10 x 1 x 0.6 m or 5 x 1 x 0.6 m or 3 x 1x 0.6m using cement trough or GI trough. The bed should be filled with 20 mm stones upto 25 cm and  over  which  finely  sewed  river  sand  can  be  filled.  The  trough  should  have  facility  for drainage. The raised beds can be covered with 100 micron UV stabilized polyethylene film on the top and covered with insect proof mesh to protect the plants and to ensure its freeness from pest and diseases.

## Fertigation

The clonal garden should be maintained with irrigation at an interval of every one hour and supplemented with the following nutrients.

 Urea - 300-400 g/m 2

 SSP

- 150-175 g/m 2

 KCL -

175-250 g/m 2

 Micro nutrient mixture -

100 g/m

2

The nutrients can be applied twice or thrice depending on the rate of growth of plants.

## Clonal Management

The  plants  are  allowed  to  grow  upto  60  days  by  applying  the  required  nutrient composition. After 60 days the plants are pruned at required size preferably at half of the plant to  induce new shoots. With continuous irrigation and nutrient management the cuttings will start  producing  shoots  from  8-10  days  onwards  and  after  15-20  days  the  cuttings  can  be collected and treated with 2% carbendazim solution.

## Clonal Treatment

The  newly  induced  shoots  were  separated  from  the  plants  and  are  treated  with  or without  1500  ppm  IBA  (liquid  formulation)  and  planted  in  90  cc  root  trainers  filled  with decomposed coir pith. The rooting started in 15 days and 25 days old rooted plants are ready for hardening.

## Green House Conditions

The root trainers are kept under green house conditions with a temperature regime of 32 - 35°C and a relative humidity of 85-95%. Periodical watering once in every 30 minutes is preferred.

## Acclimatization and Hardening

The rooted plants are hardened in a shade house condition with 50% shading for 7-15 days and maintained with adequate irrigations. After hardening chamber, the plants are lifted to open nursery for 30 days. Watering is done 2 times a day and the fertilizer of all 19 (N:P:K) can be applied at the rate of 5g/plant. During this hardening, application of carbendazim (2g/l) or triazophos (2ml/lr) is recommended based on the incidence of diseases and pests.

## VALUE ADDITION OF PLANTATION RESIDUES THROUGH BRIQUETTING TECHNLOGY

Briquetting is the process of converting low bulk density biomass into high density and energy concentrated fuel briquettes besides compacting the loose biomass into dense block.

## Raw materials for Briquetting

Almost  all  agro  and  forest  residues  can  be  briquetted.  Agro  and  forest  residues include saw dust, rice husk, groundnut shell, cotton stalks, wood chips etc. Forest residues such as plantation residues, mill residues (ply wood and match wood residues) can be used for making briquettes. All these residues can be briquetted individually and in combination with  or  without  using  binders.  The  factors  that  mainly  influence  the  selection  of  raw materials are moisture content, ash content, flow characteristics, particle size and availability of raw materials. Moisture content in the range of 10-15% is preferred because high moisture content will pose problems in binding and more energy for drying. The ash content  of  biomass  affects  its  slagging  behaviour,  operating  conditions  and  mineral composition  of  ash.  Biomass  feedstock  having  upto  4%  of  ash  content  is  preferred  for briquetting.  Granular  homogeneous  materials  which  can  flow  easily  in  conveyers  are suitable for briquetting.

## Briquetting Process

The series of steps involved in the briquetting process are as follows:

## i. Collection of raw material

In general, any material that will burn but is not in a convenient shape, size or form to be readily usable as fuel is a good candidate for briquetting.

## ii. Preparation of raw materials

Preparation of raw materials includes size reduction, drying, mixing of raw materials in correct proportion, mixing of raw materials with binders etc.

## iii. Size reduction

Raw  material  is  first  reduced  in  size  by  chopping,  crushing,  breaking,  rolling,

hammering, milling, grinding, cutting etc. until it reaches a suitably small and uniform sized material (1 to 10). For some material which are available in the size range of 1 to 10 mm need  not  be  sized  reduced.  Since  the  size  reduction  process  consumes  a  good  deal  of energy, this should be as short as possible. Biomass with irregular size which was difficult to handle. This size of biomass reduced with the help of Shredder machine. Biomass passed through  the  shredding  machine  for  size  reduction  and  powder  of  uniform  size  is  made. Shredder  size  22'  and  sharp  rotating  blades  rotated  at  a  speed  of  3300  RPM  is  used. Generally sieve size is 1/16 inch.

## Drying

Raw materials  are  available  with  high  moisture  content  than  what  is  required  for briquetting. Drying can be dome in open air (sun), with a heater or with hot air. At the time of  harvesting,  the  biomass  contains  more  than  40  percentage  of  moisture  content.  For briquetting we need the moisture content of biomass to be in the range of 10-12 percent. Moisture reduction is done using a solar dryer.

## Raw material mixing

It  is  done  to  make  briquettes  from  more  than  one  raw  material.  Mixing  has  to  be done in  proper  way  so  that  the  product  should  have  good  compaction  and  high  calorific value.

## Mixing of raw material with binders

Mixing  of  raw  materials  with  binders  in  correct  proportion  is  important  for  the production  of  briquettes  with  good  compaction.  This  is  best  accomplished  by  a  trial  and error method of making several briquettes with different mixtures of binding material and testing  each  for  its  mechanical  strength  and  burning  characteristics.  The  cost  of  binding material  can  be  a  critical  factor  for  economic  success  of  the  project.  Natural  or  synthetic resins,  tar,  animal  manure  ,  molasses,  lingo-sulphates,  sewage  mud,  fish  water,  algae, starch, slime, clay, mud, and  cement are some of the binders used in briquetting process.

## Compaction

Compaction  process  takes  place  inside  the  briquetting  machine  and  the  process depends on the briquetting technology adopted.

## Cooling and storage of briquettes

Briquettes extruding out of the machine are hot with temperatures exceeding 200°c and hence they have to be cooled and stored.

## Parameters considered for design of the briquette machine:

Bio waste used: saw dust / ground nut / coffee husk / agricultural / forest waste Max Moisture Level in Bio waste: 8 - 10 %

## MULTIFUNCTIONAL AGROFORESTRY

Agroforestry is one of the oldest land use practices which combines the components of agriculture  and  forestry  production  within  the  same  unit  area  of  the  land.  This agroforestry combines the production of diverse but essential resources for local subsistence. The traditional agroforestry has not seen as an intensive or highly optimised production  concept.  However,  its  importance  and  strength  is  located  within  its  diverse usability in long term  production  system  and  comparatively  sustainable impacts in environment and ecosystem functions. The traditional agroforestry system has been utilized as  a  land  use  system  to  increase  the  livelihood  security  and  reduce  the  vulnerability  to climate and environmental change. The agroforestry systems have provided food, fuel, and fodder besides protecting the natural resources. But today, the rapid phases of population growth coupled with developmental projects have necessitated large volume of wood and wood  products  from  tree  outside  forests  particularly  from  agroforestry  plantations.  The industrialization and globalization has made production process more intensified and highly specialized.  However,  the  agroforestry  practices  are  unable  to  keep  up  with  the  higher economic and mono-culture oriented production.

In  India,  the  agroforestry  supports  nearly  72%  of  fuel  wood  demand,  over  70%  of plywood,  60-80%  of  pulpwood  and  around  11%  of  fodder  needs  besides  satisfying  the domestic needs of the society. In case of timber demand the agroforestry is able to meet 2/3 rd of  the  requirement.  The  role  of  agroforestry  in  soil  water  conservation,  Biodiversity conservation  and  mitigation  and  adaptation  to  climate  change  are  very  well  established. Hence, agroforestry has played a significant role in extending the multifunctional benefits to the  society  and  to  the  environment.  Against  this  back  drop  Forest  College  and  Research Institute has conceived and developed a Multifunctional agroforestry model for adoption to double the farmer's income through enhancing productivity per unit area.

## MULTIFUNCTIONAL AGROFORESRY SYSTEM - A PILOT MODEL

The Forest College and Research Institute of Tamil Nadu Agricultural University has designed and established a multifunctional agroforestry model on a pilot basis in 0.75 acre of  land.  This  multifunctional  model  has  been  conceptualized  with  an  idea  of  ensuring monthly income to the farmers practicing the model. This model is conceived based on the fact that the government officials are getting salary on 30 th of every month and it is based on this idea the model is conceived and implemented that every month the farmer may also get  income  from  one  or  other  components  of  multifunctional  agroforestry  systems. Accordingly the model has been established and it consists of the following components.

| Revenue  :               | Atleast Rs. 550 - 1000 / day                      |

All  these  components  have  been  incorporated  in  a  circular  model  and  the  same .After  three  to  six  months  of  development,  the  annual  crop  components  start  generating income and after one year, the entire  model  has  become  functionally  active  to  generate income  on  monthly  basis  to  the  growers.  The  functionality  and  its  economic  impact  are monitored  from  the  inception  of  the  model  and  will  bring  good  database  for  promoting multifunctional agroforestry system in a long term approach.

## 16.INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEMS RESEARCH IN TAMIL NADU

The marginal and small farmers constitute 78.2 per cent of the farming community in India. The unique Indian situation of small fragmented holdings and lack of capital investments is not  suitable  for  single commodity farming being practiced in developed countries. So, the integrated    farming    system  appears  to  be  a  viable  solution  to  the  Indian  agriculture  for increasing  productivity  and  income    of  the  small  and  marginal  farmers  with  constrained resources. Efforts for a holistic integration of different farming enterprises with cropping were carried out for Western, Cauvery delta, Southern  and North western  zones out of seven agro climatic zones of Tamil Nadu with the objectives of increasing income and recycling  of farm wastes and by-products to sustain the soil productivity since 1985. The approaches were to find out  viable  components  for  wetland,  irrigated  upland  and  rainfed    situations    existing    in different  ecological  zones.

## INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEMS

## 1. WESTERN ZONE

## WETLAND

Integrated  farming  systems  experiments  were  conducted  at  wetlands  from  1987onwards at Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore involving different components viz ., poultry,  pigeon, goat, fishery and mushroom.

## Crop + poultry/ pigeon + fish + mushroom

In this system, the component of integrated farming system involved were crop + fish + mushroom, crop + poultry + fish + mushroom and crop + pigeon + fish + mushroom and was taken  from  1993-1995. The efficiency of the component linkages was evaluated predominantly on the  basis  of  productivity,  its income and employment generation with the possibility of utilizing recycled organic  wastes  as  nutrient  to enrich the soil fertility.

To enhance and sustain the productivity, economic returns, employment generation for  the  family  labour  round  the  year  and  soil  fertility  with  environmental  protection, integration  of  rice-gingelly-  maize  and  rice-  soybean  -sunflower  cropping  each  in  0.45  ha with recycled poultry  manure  as fish  pond silt to rice and 75 per cent of the recommended NPK to each crop in the system + poultry (50 layers) + fish (1000 polyculture fingerlings in 0.10 ha of ponded water) comprising catla (20 per cent), silver carp (20 per cent), rohu (20 per cent), mrigal  (15 per cent), common  carp (15 per cent)  and  grass carp (10 per cent) fed with poultry dropping + oyster mushroom  (5kg/day)  for  the  lowland farmers having one hectare  farm.

## Cropping + poultry / pigeon / goat + fishery

During 1998-2001, the study involved cropping,  poultry,  pigeon,  goat and fishery enterprises  in  all  possible  combinations,  with  a  view  to  recycle  the  residue    and    byproducts  of one  component over the other. In one hectare farm, an area of 0.75 ha was assigned for crop activity, 0.10 ha for growing  fodder  grass  to  feed  the  goat  unit  (20+1), 0.03 ha allotted  to goat shed and the remaining   0.12  ha  allotted  to  3  fish  ponds.  Three integrated farming systems viz., crop  + fish  + poultry  (20 Bapkok layer birds), crop + fish +

pigeon  (40  pairs)  and  crop  +  fish  +  goat  (Tellicherry  breed    of  20    female  and  1  male maintained in 0.03 ha deep litter system) were tried for three years. Polyculture fingerlings of  400  numbers  (catla,  rohu,  mirgal/  common  carp  and  grass  carp)  in  the  ratio    of 40:20:30:10, respectively, reared in 3 ponds of size 0.04 ha (depth of 1.5 m) each.

Integration of crop with fish, poultry, pigeon and goat resulted in higher productivity than cropping alone under lowland.  Crop + fish + goat integration  recorded  higher  rice grain  equivalent    yield  of  39610  kg/ha.  The  highest  net  return  of  Rs.131118  and  per  day return  of  Rs.511  ha -1 were  obtained  by  integrating  goat  +  fish  +  cropping  applied  with recycled fishpond silt enriched with goat droppings. Higher  net  return  of  Rs.3.36  for every rupee invested was obtained by  integration  of pigeon + fish + cropping applied with recycled  fishpond  silt  enriched  with  pigeon  droppings.  The    poultry,  pigeon  and  goat droppings were utilized as feed initially and at the end of a year after the fish harvest, about 4500 kg of settled silt from each pond were collected. The pond silt was utilized as organic sources to supply sufficient quantity of nutrients to the crops.

## IRRIGATED UPLAND

## Crop + Dairy + Biogas + Mushroom + Fish

Integration of 0.32 ha each of sorghum + red gram - sunflower + coriander, maize + fodder  cowpea  -  cotton  +  coriander  and  perennial  fodder  CO3  grass  +  legume  fodder (Lucerne) with dairy (6 cows + 4 calves), biogas (2 m  capacity) and mushroom (2 kg day 3 -1 ) + spawn production (10 bottles day -1 )  recorded higher productivity than the cropping alone with sorghum - cotton (0.50 ha) and maize - cotton (0.50 ha) cropping systems. Cropping + dairy + biogas +  fish  +  mushroom  integration recorded the highest gross, net and per day returns. It also registered the highest benefit cost ratio of 2.41 during 2000-2001.

On farm study was conducted during 2004-2007. The crop activity  in  integrated farming system consisted of field crop, vegetable crop and fodder crops. The livestock  kept were two cross  bred milch cows + one calf, ten female tellicherry does + one buck and twenty guinea fowls. Improved farming system gave the maximum maize grain equivalent yield of 22,754 kg/ac/year which was 47.9 % higher than the traditional farming system. The improved system was able to generate  employment  of 235 man day's acre -1 which was higher  than  traditional  farming  system  (105  man  day's  acre -1 ).  Through  recycling  of  crop residues  and  livestock  manure  about  3.72  tonnes  of  bio-compost  and  1.59  tonnes  of vermicompost  were obtained.  This could  able to supply  26.0, 22.3, and 26.0 kg N P K to field  and  fodder  crops  through biocompost application and 39.4,10.5 and 18.0 kg NPK to vegetable  crops as vermicompost application in an acre land area. The returns per rupee of investment from the ratio of gross value of output to total cost (GVCR)  was 3.62 and ratio of net value of the products  to  total cost (NVCR) was 2.80.

## RAINFED LAND

## Crop + Tree + Goat

Integrated farming system model involving crop + tree + goat was taken from 19992001.  Experimental  results  on  integrated  farming  system  revealed  that  (i)  integration  of sorghum  +  cowpea  (grain),  sorghum  +  cowpea  (fodder)  and C.  glaucus each  in  0.33  ha

intercropped  in E.  officinalis with  Tellichery  goat  component  (5+1)  in  0.01  ha  resulted  in higher  productivity,  economic  returns  and  provided  better  employment  opportunity  and improved soil  fertility  than  raising  sole  sorghum  alone  (ii)  coir  pith  mulching  and  pitcher irrigation  increased  the  tree  seedling  growth  than  the  control,  (iii)  tied  ridges  conserved more moisture and improved the productivity of the crops, (iv) application of 50 per cent N through  fertilizer  and  50  per  cent  N  through  goat  manure  increased  the  productivity, enhanced the soil fertility and provided better opportunity for recycling of manure to the crops.  Results  of  on-farm  field  experiments  conducted  during  2009  -  2011,  revealed  that, integration of Cenchrus setigerus + Stylosanthes hamata and fodder sorghum + Pillipesara with sheep (5+1) and buffalo (2 No.'s) could be the best silvipastoral farming system with the application of recommended dose of 25: 45: 19 kg ha -1 NPK for Cenchrus based system and 30: 20: 10 kg ha -1 NPK for fodder sorghum based system along with FYM (10 t ha -1 ) for dry land of Western Zone of Tamil Nadu.

## 2. CAUVERY DELTA ZONE

## Cropping + fish + poultry/duck/goat/dairy

An experiment was conducted during 1992-1994 in rice based farming system as a demonstration trial at Aduthurai. The components were cropping, fish culture and poultry. An area of 0.40 ha was selected for the farming system study, considering the small and marginal farmers of the state.  Conventional  cropping as practised by farmers was taken up in an area of  0.96 hectare. In  the  fish  pond  with  400  m ,  fingerlings  belonging  to  the 2 species viz., Catla ( Catla catla )  (200)  Rohu ( Labeo rohita )  (100),  Mirgal  ( Cirrbinus mrigala ) (100) were stocked.

The  economics  worked  out  for  the  system  as  a  whole  was  Rs.28.983,  in    which cropping system contributed Rs.23,709, Poultry and Fisheries contributed additional income of    Rs.5,274.    Poultry  droppings  added  to  the  fish  pond  as  feed  was  3  tonnes  year -1 (100g/birds). Mean number of egg production  was 262 year -1 bird -1 .    In  the  case  of  fish pond  (0.04)    yield  recorded    was  234  kg.  Of    the  income  obtained  from  the  integrated farming  system,  78%  was  from  cropping  system  and  poultry  cum  fisheries  generated additional income and employment.

## Cropping + duck + fish culture

Integrated  farming  system  with  duck-cum-fish  culture  as  a  component  was    tried during  the year 1989. Two farm  holdings  each  with  the size of one ha were selected  for conducting  the study.  In one holding, conventional cropping as practiced by farmers was followed. In another one hectare, cropping was practiced in an area of 0.973 ha and an area of  0.027  ha  was  allotted  for  duck-cum-fish  culture.  Economics  of  IFS  was  compared  with existing cropping  systems.  Net income  of Rs.13790/- was obtained from existing cropping system ( Kuruvai-thaladi rice - pulse) and a net income of  Rs.22676/- was obtained from the modified cropping system ( Kuruvai -  thaladi rice    -    cotton    and  maize)  with  an  area  of 0.973 ha allotted for cropping.

The additional profit from modified  cropping  alone  was  Rs.8886/-.  From  duckcum-fish culture as a component in mixed farming system, a net profit of Rs.1441/-  was obtained    from  an  area    of  0.027  ha.  Totally  an  additional  income  of  Rs.10327/-  was obtained from the mixed farming system over existing cropping  system.

## 3. SOUTHERN ZONE

## WETLANDS OF TAMBIRAPARANI COMMAND AREA

Evaluation of integrated farming system for wetland farms was conducted during 1990-92.

The components of the traditional and integrated farming systems are as follows:

Traditional  system (1 ha)

: Rice - Rice - Fallow Integrated farming system  (1

ha) :

Crop + dairy + fishery

0.4 ha :

Rice-rice + soybean (bund) -  blackgram

0.2 ha :

Ragi + sunflower (border) - fodder maize +

cowpea - cotton + Greengram

0.2 ha :

Bajra napier hybrid fodder  grass

0.1 ha :

Desmanthus

0.04 ha :

Fish pond

0.06 ha :

Cattle shed for 3 jersey cows and 2 work bullocks

The integrated farming system provided a net income of Rs.25,215/-  which  was 100.7  per cent more than the income from the traditional rice farming  (Rs.12,662/-

On-farm studies were also undertaken to assess the economic benefits of integrated farming systems actually practised by wetland farmers of Tirunelveli-Kattabomman district during 1990. The study covered four farms in four villages with a farm size of 1-2 ha, raising rice,  banana    and  pulses.    The  allied  activities  includes  dairy,  goat  rearing,  poultry  and fishery. The average  monthly  income  of the farm family practicing the integrated farming system varied from Rs.1,850 to 2,560.

## WETLANDS OF PERIYAR VAIGAI COMMAND AREA

In  the  Periyar  -  Vaigai  command  area,  nearly  one  lakh  hectares  are  raised  with  a single  crop  of  rice  during  August  -  January.  The  lands  are  usually    left  fallow    after    rice harvest  in January.  To  assess the potential of IFS in such single crop wetlands, experiments were conducted at Agricultural College and Research Institute, Madurai during 1989-91. The results revealed that by crop intensification, diversified cropping and by inclusion of fishery and poultry, the farm income per acre could be increased by Rs.5435 to Rs.6235 per year.

## DRY LANDS OF SOUTHERN ZONE

To  identify suitable integrated farming  for the dry lands, experiments  were conducted  at  Regional  Research  Station,  Aruppukottai  and  Agricultural  Research  Station, Kovilpatti.  In  the  rainfed  black  soils,  the  common  crops  are  sorghum,  pulses,  cotton  and sunflower. Introduction of tree legumes like subabul, Acacia senegal and Prosopis cineraria and perennial fodder grass Cenchrus ciliaris and inclusion of goat rearing were evaluated at Regional  Research  Station,  Aruppukottai.    Five  female  and  one  male  goat  of  Tellicherry breed  were  raised  in  deep  litter  system.  The  results  revealed  that  the  IFS  yielded  an additional income of Rs.2163 to Rs.2556 per year from a farm area of 1.6 ha. In another study at Aruppukottai proved the IFS system of crop + horticulture  +  goat proven to be successful  in  the  black  soils  and  increased  the  profit  by  Rs.2363  to  Rs.4706  per  ha  over cropping alone.

At Agricultural Research Station, Kovilpatti, studies were taken in farmers' holdings in  the  dryland  red  soils.  IFS  with  crop+goat  yielded  an  annual  income  of  Rs.8410  per    ha compared  to Rs.4654 per ha under traditional cropping alone.

## 4. NORTH WESTERN ZONE

The  studies  were  made  under  garden  land  condition.  The  results  revealed  that  in both Paiyur and Yercaud Centres dairy linked farming system was more remunerative, with more employment generation. The next successful farming system under rainfed condition at Paiyur was sericulture.

## 18. SOIL RELATED CONSTRAINTS AND THEIR  MANAGEMENT

A constraint free soil environment is very important for achieving higher food production. The major soil constraints affecting the crop production in Tamil Nadu are

a)

Chemical constraints  :

salinity, sodicity, acidity and nutrient toxicities

b) Physical constraints : high or low permeability, sub soil hard pan,

surface crusting, fluffy paddy soils, sandy soils etc.

## 1. Saline soils

Saline soils are characterised by higher amount of water soluble salt, due to which the crop growth is affected. For these soils with electrical conductivity of more than  4 dS m -1 , provision    of  lateral  and  main  drainage  channels  of  60  cm  deep  and  45  cm    wide    and leaching  of  salts  could reclaim the soils. Application of farm yard manure  at 5 t ha -1 at 10 - 15 days before  transplanting  in  the case of paddy crop and before sowing in the case of garden land crops can alleviate  the problems  of salinity.

## 2. Sodic soils

Sodic soils are characterised by the predominance of sodium in the complex with the exchangeable sodium percentage exceeding 15 and the pH more than 8.5 .To reclaim the sodic  soils,  plough  the  soil  at  optimum  soil  moisture  regime,    apply    gypsum    at    50% gypsum  requirement uniformly, impound  water, provide drainage  for leaching out the soluble salts and apply green manure at 5 t ha -1 10 to 15 days before transplanting in the case of paddy  crop.

## 3. Acid soils

Acid soils are characteristically low in pH (&lt; 6.0).  Predominance  of H   and  Al + 3+ cause acidity resulting in deficiency of P, K, Ca, Mg , Mo and B. This soils are prevalent in a) hilly tracts  of    Ooty,  Kodaikkanal  and    Yercaud        b)          Laterite    soils    of    Pudukkottai, Kanyakumari    etc   Application of lime ( as  per  the  lime  requirement  test ) uniformly  by broadcast and incorporation is recommended.  The alternate amendments like dolomite, basic slag, flue dust, wood ash, pulp mill lime may also  be used on lime equivalent  basis .

## 4. Iron and Aluminum toxicity

These are characterized by the presence of higher concentration of Fe 2+ and Al 3+ more specifically in flooded soils. Prevalent in Kanyakumari and Pudukkottai Districts. Application of lime as per the lime requirement along with the  recommended  dose  of NPK  and  organic manure will suppress the toxicity.

For ` Ela ` soils of Kanyakumari district (Alfisols, pH : 4-5 ) ,. application of lime as per lime requirement with recommended NPK + foliar spray of 0.5 % ZnSO4 + 0.2% CuSO4 +1% DAP + 1% MOP thrice during AT to PI  will help to overcome  the problem  in rice. Based on the screening  tests, the rice cultivars of the region have been rated for their tolerance to Fe toxicity

Highly susceptible          : ADT 36

Mod. susceptible

:  ADT 42, IR 50, CORH  1

Less susceptible

:  TPS 1, ASD 16 &amp; 18, IR 64, JJ 92, TKM 9, CO 37 &amp; CO 41

## 5. Fluffy paddy soils

The  traditional  method  of  preparing  the  soil  for  transplanting  rice  consists  of puddling which results in substantial break down of aggregates with uniform structures less mass.  Under  continuous  flooding  and  submergence  of  soil  in  a  rice-rice-rice  cropping system, the soil particles are always in a state of flux and the mechanical strength  is lost leading  to the fluffy  ness.  This  is further  aggrevated by insitu application of rice stubbles and  weeds  during  puddling.  They  are  characterized  by  low  bulk  density  of  the  top  soil resulting  in  the  sinking  of  farm  animals    and    labourers    as    well    as    poor  anchorage  to paddy seedlings. For such soils, passing of 400 kg stone roller or oil drum  with sand  inside eight  times  at  proper  moisture  level  (moisture  level  at  friable  condition  of  soil  which  is approximately 13 per cent) once in two to three years.

## 6. Sandy soils

Sandy  soils are containing  predominant  amounts  of  sand  resulting  in  higher percolation  rates  and  nutrient  losses.  Campacting  the  soil  with  400  kg  stone  roller  or  oil drum with sand / stones  inside  eight  times  at  proper  moisture  level  (  moisture    level  at friable  condition  of soil which  is approximately 13 per cent ) once in two to three years could  reduce  the  percolation  losses.  Addition  of  tank  silt  for  coastal  sandy  soils  is recommended for enhancing their productivity.

## 7. Sub Soil hard pan

Hard pan occurs in red soil areas due to the movement of clay and iron hydroxides and calcium carbonate and settling at shallow depth, which increases the soil bulk density to  more  than  1.8  g/cc,  their  by  preventing  the  root  proliferation. These  soils  can  be reclaimed by chiselling the soils with chisel plough at 0.5 m interval first in one direction and then  in  the  direction  perpendicular  to  the  previous  one,  once  in  two  to  three  years. Applications of FYM or composted  coir pith at 12.5 t ha-1could  bring additional  yields of about 30 per cent over control. Deep  ploughing  of   the field during summer season can be followed to open up the sub soil. Cultivation of deep  rooted  crops like tapioca, cotton and semipereneal crop like mulberry encourage natural breaking of the hardpan.

## 8. Surface crusted soils

Surface  crusting  occurs  due  to  the  presence  of  colloidal  oxides  of  iron    and aluminium  in Alfisols which binds the soil particles under wet regimes. On drying it forms  a hard    mass    on  the    surface  and  prevents  the  emerging  seedlings  and  arrest  the  free exchange of gases between the soil and atmosphere. The surface crust can be easily broken by harrowing or cultivator ploughing and its formation can be prevented by improving  the aggregate  stability  by the application  of lime or gypsum at 2 t ha -1 and FYM at 12.5 t ha -1 . Sprinkle  water at periodic  intervals.  Bold grain crops like cowpea  may be grown

## 9. Heavy textured clay soils

The clay soils are containing major amounts  of clay resulting in the poor permeability and nutrient fixation. Such soils  can be reclaimed  by the addition  of river sand at 100 t ha -1 or managed  by deep ploughing  the field  with  mould  board  plough  or

disc plough  during  summer  or  forming  contour  and  compartmental  bunds  and  also adoption of ridges and furrows to enhance the infiltration and percolation.

## 10. Low permeable black soils

These  soils  are  having  infiltration  rate  less  than  6  cm  per  day  due  to  high  clay content. The amount of water entering in to the soil is reduced, resulting in high run off encouraging the erosion of surface soil with nutrients. Heavy clay and high capillary porosity results in impeded drainage and reduced  soil  conditions. Application of 100 cart loads of red loam soil or river sand and deep ploughing the field with mould board plough or disc plough during summer to enhance  the infiltration  and percolation. Application of FYM , composted coir pith or pressmud at 25  t ha -1 per  year  will improve the physical properties and internal drainage of the  soil.

## 11. High permeable red soils

These soils are having sand exceeding 70 per cent and are not able to retain water and nutrients. These soils are devoid of finer particles and organic matter, thus aggregates are  weekly  formed;  presence  of  high  non  capillary    pores  results    in  poor  soil  structure. Compacting  the soil with 15 passes after 24 hours of irrigation, application of tank silt or black  soil @ 25 t ha -1 per year along  with FYM, composted coir pith to improve the water holding capacity of the soil. Providing asphalt, polythene sheet etc below the soil surface will reduce  infiltration

## 19. CHISEL TECHNOLOGY

The  occurrence  of  hard  pans  at  shallow  depth  is  the  most  prevalent  soil  physical constraint in soils. The agricultural crops are denied  of the full benefits  of the soil fertility and nutrient  use due to  this constraint. The sub-soil hard pans are characterized by high bulk density (1.8 g cc.') which in turn lowers infiltration, water storage capacity, available water and movement of air and nutrients, with concomitant adverse effect on the yield of crops.  This  problem  is  predominantly    present    in  six  districts  of  Tamil  Nadu  viz., Coimbatore,  Erode,  Dharmapuri,  Tiruchirappalli,  Madurai  and  Salem  particularly  under rainfed farming affecting a total of 3.8 lakh hectares of land.

## TECHNOLOGY

Plough the field with chisel  plough  at 50 cm interval  in both the directions  viz., horizontally  and vertically. Chiselling helps to break the hard pan in the sub soil. Besides, it ploughs upto 45cm depth. Chisel plough is a heavy iron plough which  goes up to 45 cm depth,  thereby  shattering  the  hard pans. It is usually drawn by the tractor. Fabrication of chisel plough has been done by the Department of Farm Machinery, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore.

-  Spread 12.5 t of FYM / pressmud / composted coir pith per hectare evenly on the surface.
-  Give two ploughings using a country plough for incorporating the added manures. The broken hard pan and incorporation of manures make the soil to conserve more moisture.

## Vegetative barriers for soil moisture conservation

For  better  in-situ  moisture  conservation  in  drylands  of  Vertisols,  raise  vegetative barriers of vettiver or lemon grass across the slope and along the contours at 0.5 m vertical interval.

## 20. SURGE IRRIGATION

Even as advanced pressure irrigation method, such as drip and  sprinkler  systems  are  in vogue the traditional gravity surface irrigation methods still remain inevitable due to their simplicity in layouts and low installation and operational expenses. However the  short  strip furrow    and    check    basin  layouts  (the  primary  surface  irrigation  methods  in  Tamilnadu) warrant division  of the irrigated  fields into a number of square or rectangular (2 m x 2 m to 6 m x 6 m ) plots  encompassed  by criss-  cross ridges and feeder channels for facilitating irrigation  flow  from  head  to  tail  end  of  the  field.  This  eventually  results  in  prolonged irrigation  application  time    and  reduced    irrigation    efficiencies    of  55  -  65%  only  due  to excessive  seepage,  deep  percolation  and  runoff  losses  (35-45%).  Besides,  the  criss-  cross layout  with  cross  ridges  and  feeder  channels  leads  to  land  loss  of  15  -25%.  In    view    of minimizing the land and water loss and to accomplish high level  of  irrigation  and  water use  efficiencies  a  relatively  new  surface  irrigation  method  called  'surge  irrigation'  was introduced  in  TNAU    with  extensive  experimental  trials  on  it's  hydraulic  performance evaluation and  crop compatibility during 1992-95.

## Features of Surge irrigation

The  term  '  Surge  irrigation'  refers  to  the  delivering  irrigation  flows  into  individual  long furrows (more than 25 m upto 200 m) in an intermittent fashion of predetermined ON-OFF time  cycles  (5 minute to 10 minutes) with the design duration of irrigation. During the ON time water front advances  into the furrow over a certain length and during the subsequent OFF time the water applied partially saturates the soil and infiltration rate  gets reduced  on the advanced  length.  When  water  is delivered in the succeeding ON time, the water front advance gets accelerated due to the reduced  intake  rate  and eventually it reaches the tail end of long furrow with in 30  - 50%  of  the  design  duration  of irrigation. This process of ON-OFF water supply and cutoff results in  highly  minimized  deep  percolation and runoff losses (hardly exceeding 20%). Hence, high uniformity of  soil  moisture distribution with in the effective root zone is achieved over the entire furrow  length  resulting  in enhanced irrigation efficiencies of more than 85% to 95%. In addition  due  to  the  series  of  long furrows emanating from a single head channel, the criss - cross ridges and feeder  channel of division  are eliminated thereby limiting the land loss within 5%  only.

## Contributions of TNAU in surge irrigation research

- · Manual semi automated and automated surge irrigation layouts were designed  and the irrigation parameters such as the individual furrow discharges (30 lit/min to 120 lit/min),  surge  cycle  ON-OFF  times  (5  min  to  30  min),  surge  cycle  ratio    (0.25    to 0.66),  furrow  gradients  (0.1% to 0.6%), furrow size (30-120cm) and furrow length (50-200m) could be optimized  through mathematical  models.
- · A  significant  contribution  from  TNAU  is  the  development  of  an  original  emprical model  for  the  prediction  of  waterfront  advance  times  and  resulting  in  irrigation water distribution efficiencies.

## Limitations

Surge irrigation systems do not show marked differences in land and water saving  in extremely clay or sandy soils. Besides, surge irrigation technology is still in the infant  stage in India and requires popularization through extension methods.

## 21. MICRO IRRIGATION

Micro irrigation is a modern method of irrigation; by this method water is irrigated through drippers, sprinklers, foggers and by other emitters on surface or subsurface of the land. Major components of a micro irrigation system is as follows.

Water source, pumping devices (motor and pump), ball valves, fertigation equipments,  filters,  control  valves,  PVC  joining  accessories  (Main  and  sub  main)  and emitters. In  this  system  water  is  applied  drop  by  drop  nearer  the  root  zone  area  of the  crop.   The drippers are fixed based on the spacing of crop. Many different types of emitters    are  available    in  the  market.  They  are  classified  as  Inline  drippers,  on    line drippers,  Micro  tubes,  Pressure compensated drippers.

Drip  irrigation  is  most  suitable  for  wider  spacing  crops.  Micro  sprinkler  irrigation system    is  mostly  followed  in  sandy  or  loamy  soils.  This  system  is  most  suitable  to horticultural crops and small grasses. In this method water is sprinkled in a lower height at various directions.

Portable micro sprinklers are also available. They distribute slightly more water than drippers and micro sprinklers. They spray water in not more than one meter.  It is used  for preparing  nursery  and lawns in soils with low water holding capacity.

## Advantages of drip irrigation system

- · Water saving and higher  yield
- · High quality and increased fruit size
- · Suitable for all types of  soil
- · Easy method of fertigation and chemigation
- · Saving in labour and field preparation cost

## Disadvantage of drip irrigation system

- · High initial investment
- · Clogging of emitters
- · Possible damage of system components due to animals,  etc.,

## Investment cost mostly differs based on spacing of the crops

- · Generally, the reasons for clogging are solid particles (sand, rust), soft dirt (organic matter, algae, micro organism, salt), sediments (salt in the fertilizers).
- · Filtration is the main key factor to the success or failure of the system. The aim of filtration is to stop dirt particles which damage any components of the system.

- · To  remove  salt  encrustation,  30  per  cent  commercial  hydrochloric  acid  can  been used at the rate of one liter per one m  of system discharge. 3
- · To remove algae and fungal clogging 5 to 500 ppm sodium hydrochloride (10 per cent chlorine) can be used.

## Maintenance of drip system

- · Back washing and sand filters has to be cleaned
- · Frequent cleaning of emitters and drippers
- · Flushing at every irrigation
- · Cleaning of sub main and main  pipes
- · Cleaning  of  PVC  pipes  and  laterals  and  acid  or  chlorine  may  be  used  to  remove clogging.

## Affordable micro irrigation systems

Affordable micro irrigation system is mostly suitable to  kitchen  garden,  nursery and ornamental crops.

## 1. Bucket kit system

Bucket  kit  system  is  designed  for  kitchen  garden  suitable  for  women,  marginal    and small  farmers. It consists of a bucket (15 lit.) 10 metre long lateral  (12mm)  fitted  with drippers  (4 LPH),  which can irrigate about 100 plants in approximately  15 m  area.  The 2 bucket  is placed  at a height of 1m (3 feet) and water is filled for 4 to 5 times daily.

## 2. Drum kit system

This  system  is  ideally  suitable  to  kitchen  garden  and    small    commercial    vegetable growers. The drum is having 200 liter capacity which would supply water approximately 500 plants by filling the drum twice daily. It consists of lateral (16mm and 12mm). One  number of 16mm  lateral  and  five 12mm laterals are used. This system could cover an area of 120 m 2 (3 cents).

## 3. Micro sprinkler system

Micro sprinkler kit is suitable for farmers with access to pressurised water. It is very useful  for  groundnut,  vegetables,  nurseries    home  gardens,    and  lawns  etc.  It  can  be connected  with a tap from  an overhead tank or a domestic water pump. It consists of 15 micro sprinklers with pipes irrigating an area of 250 m  (6 cents). Fertigation can also be 2 done through this method.

|   Sl.  No. | Item                     | Selling Cost/Unit             | Area covered   by the kits   |
|------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
|          1 | Bucket Kit (Drip system) | Rs.225                        | 20 m  (0.5 cent)  2          |
|          2 | Drum  Kit (Drip system)  | Rs.600  (Excluding Drum Cost) | 120 m  (3.0 cents)  2        |
|          3 | Micro sprinkler kit      | Rs.900                        | 240 m  (6.0 cents)  2        |

## Fertigation

Fertigation is a method of fertilizer application in which fertilizer is incorporated within the irrigation water by the drip system. In this system fertilizer solution  is distributed evenly  in irrigation.  The availability of nutrients is very high therefore the efficiency is more.  In this method  liquid  fertilizer as well as water soluble fertilizers are used. By this method, fertilizer  use efficiency  is increased  from 80 to 90 per cent.

Fertilizer efficiencies of various application methods

|             | Fertilizer use efficiency (%)   | Fertilizer use efficiency (%)   |
|-------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Nutrient    | Soil application                | Fertigation                     |
| Nitrogen    | 30-50                           | 95                              |
| Phosphorous | 20                              | 45                              |
| Potassium   | 50                              | 80                              |

## Advantages of fertigation

- · Nutrients and water are supplied near the active root zone through fertigation which results in greater absorption by the crops.
- · As water and fertilizer are supplied evenly to all the crops through fertigation there is  possibility for getting 25-50 per cent higher yield.
- · Fertilizer use efficiency through fertigation ranges between 80-90 per cent, which helps to  save a minimum of 25 per cent of  nutrients.
- · By this way, along with less amount of water and saving of fertilizer, time, labour

and energy use is also reduced  substantially.

## Fertilizer used in fertigation

- · Urea, potash and highly water soluble fertilizers are available for applying through fertigation.
- · Application of super phosphorus through fertigation  must be avoided  as it makes precipitation of phosphate  salts. Thus phosphoric acid is more  suitable for fertigation as it is available  in liquid form.
- · Special fertilisers like mono ammonium phosphate (Nitrogen and Phosphorus), poly feed  (Nitrogen,  Phosphorus  and  Potassium),  Multi  K    (Nitrogen    and    Potassium), Potassium sulphate (Potassium and Sulphur) are highly suitable for fertigation    as they  are  highly  soluble  in  water.  Fe,  Mn,  Zn,  Cu,  B,  Mo  are  also  supplied  along with special fertilisers.

## N fertigation

Urea is well suited for injection in micro  irrigation  system.  It  is  highly  soluble  and dissolves in non-ionic form, so that it does not react with other substances in the water. Also  urea  does  not  cause  precipitation  problems.  Urea,  ammonium  nitrate,  ammonium sulphate, calcium ammonium sulphate, calcium ammonium nitrate are used as nitrogenous fertilizers in drip fertigation.

## P fertigation

Application of phosphorus to irrigation water may cause precipitation of phosphate salts.  Phosphoric  acid  and  mono  ammonium  phosphate  appears  to  be  more  suitable  for fertigation.

## K fertigation

Application  of  K  fertilizer  does  not  cause  any  precipitation  of  salts.    Potassium nitrate, Potassium chloride, Potassium sulphate and mono potassium phosphate are used in drip fertigation.

## Micro nutrients

Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, B, Mo could be used as micro nutrients in drip fertigation.

## Fertigation equipments

Three main groups of equipments used in drip system are :

- · Ventury
- · Fertilizer tank
- · Fertilizer pump

## Ventury

Constriction  in  the  main  water  flow  pipe  causes  a  pressure  difference  (Vaccum) which is sufficient to suck fertilizer solution from an open container into the water flow. It is very  easy  to  handle  and  it  is  affordable  even  by  small  farmers.  This  equipment  is  most suitable for smaller area.

## Fertilizer tank

A tank containing fertilizer solution is connected to the irrigation  pipe at the supply point.    Part    of  the  irrigation  water  is  diverted  through  the  tank  diluting  the  nutrient solution  and returning  to the  main supply pipe. The concentration of fertilizer in the tank thus becomes gradually reduced.

## Fertilizer pump

The  fertilizer  pump  is  a  standard  component    of  the  control  head.  The  fertilizer solution  is held in non-pressurised tank and it can be injected into the irrigation water  at any desired  ratio. Therefore  the fertilizer availability to each plants is maintained  properly.

## Cost of fertigation equipments

|   Sl.No. | Fertigation devices   |   Cost (Rs.) |
|----------|-----------------------|--------------|
|        1 | Ventury type          |         1200 |
|        2 | Fertilizer Tank       |         3000 |
|        3 | Injectors             |        12000 |

## Economics of drip irrigation system

The initial investment in drip irrigation system is mainly depends  upon  the spacing of  crops.  The  initial  cost  will  be  almost  75  -  85  thousand  rupees  per  hectare  for  wider spacing  crops  such  as  coconut,  mango,  grapes  and  for  orchard  crops.  The  initial  cost    is approximately   1 - 1.25 lakh rupees per hectare for close spacing crops such as sugarcane, banana, papaya, mulberry, turmeric, tapioca, vegetables and flower crops.

## Drip fertigation technology for aerobic rice Surface drip fertigation

Under aerobic rice conditions, provision of surface drip fertigation (with 0.8 m lateral spacing provided with drippers at 0.3 m distance)  scheduled  at 125 % Pan Evaporation value for  clay soil /  150 % open Pan Evaporation value for sandy soil + STCR based NPK fertigation + biofertigation of Azophosmet @ 500 mL ha -1 during panicle initiation  and flag leaf stages is recommended.

## Sub Surface drip biogation

Under  aerobic  rice  conditions,  provision    of  sub-surface    drip  fertigation    (10  cm depth with 0.8  m lateral spacing provided with drippers  at 0.3 m distance)  scheduled  at 125 % Pan  Evaporation  value for clay soil / 150 % open Pan Evaporation value for sandy soil + STCR based NPK fertigation + biofertigation of Azophosmet and seaweed extract each @ 500 mL ha -1 during panicle initiation and flag leaf stages is recommended.

## CROP PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT

## DRYLAND

## 1. Length of Growing Period

Length of growing period is defined as a period in which the available  soil moisture is enough  to meet the evapotranspiration requirement of dry land crops and hence the dry land productivity is assured. Based on scientific study (Jeevananda Reddy, 1983), length of growing  period for different  rain gauge stations of each district of different agroclimatic zones of  Tamil  Nadu  have  been  computed. The length of growing period is given as 'G' with starting and ending of length of growing period in terms of Meteorological standard weeks. If the G is less than 5 weeks period it means that always crop failures will occur. The G period must be a minimum  of 14 weeks (98 days) which permit  the dry land crop to attain its potential productivity. If the growing period is 14 weeks, a single dry land crop can be cultivated. If G period is between 14 to 20 weeks, suitable inter cropping system can be recommended. If the G period is more than 20 weeks long duration crop / double crop can be  organized.

The following information indicates length of growing period for different  district  of  Tamil Nadu. Based on the G period, suitable dry land crop may be selected.

The rainfall pattern of Tamil Nadu based on the criteria of rainfall quantity and Seasons of precipitation is given below: (NCA, 1976)

A = &gt; 30 cm rainfall per month

B = 30-20 cm rainfall per month

C = 20-10 cm rainfall per month

D = 10-5 cm rainfall per  month

E = &lt; 5 cm rainfall per month

Three distinct seasons have been considered

Pre monsoon season

:

February to May Monsoon season

:

June to September Post monsoon season :

October to January

Considering the distribution of rainfall within a season, a standard pattern is developed.

## This is explained through the following example

A2 B2 (C1 B1 A1 E ) C  D  E 1 2 1 1

Where in,

- i) Alphabets in bracket denote rainfall in monsoon season months.
- ii) Left to bracket denotes rainfall in pre-monsoon months.
- iii) Right to bracket denotes rainfall in post monsoon months.
- iv) Numerical suffix gives the number of months.

## 5. Water balance study

Water  balance  study  was  conducted  for  Tamil  Nadu  based  on  the  Water Requirement Satisfaction Index (WRSI). It is suggested that sorghum can be sown during 36 th Std week  against  16 th Std week. The data from the Table indicate that if it is sown during 16 th Std week, the crop may suffer with soil moisture stress. This result is valid for sorghum crop for Manapparai Taluk sowing by 36 th standard week is  recommended.

## 6. Weather Based Management Technologies

## i) Nutrient management for thaladi season rice

Application of 200:75:75kg NPK/ha for November 15 th transplanted crop  (Co45 or  Co43)  under split application of N at 40, 20, 20 and 20% respectively during basal, active tillering, panicle initiation and flowering while 75 percent P and K as basal and 12.5 percent P and K as foliar  spray  twice at panicle initiation and flowering stages.

## ii) Acceptable insitu moisture conservation practice for rainfed groundnut -sunflower and maize

During South West monsoon season groundnut sowing along the contour and ridging to be done three weeks after sowing. During NEM, especially  for  sunflower, the  same  technology  of contour sowing followed by ridging three weeks latter  can  be adopted.  In respect  of maize,  sowing and tieing alternate furrows with mulching of locally available material can be practiced.

## iii) Sustainable dryland management for hybrid maize (UMH 28)

Sowing of dry land hybrid maize at 38 th meteorological standard week (17 th - 23 Sept.) with modified crop production recommendation based on medium range weather forecast is suggested.

## iv) Time of sowing and nutrient level for sorghum under different rainfall situations in dryland (black soil) of western agro climate zone of Tamil Nadu

Sowing  of  sorghum  variety  CSV15  before  the  receipt  of  monsoon    rainfall (Premonsoon    sowing)  is  recommended    with  60:30:0    kg  NPK  /  ha  during    above average  rainfall  year and 40:20:0 Kg NPK / ha during below average rainfall year. The result is applicable  when  seasonal  climate forecast information is available in advance.

## v) Technical feasibility of introducing new irrigated cropping system of Greengram Maize  -  Sunflower  against  the  outdated  cropping  system  of  Cotton  -  Sorghum  Finger  millet  of western agro climatic zone of Tamil Nadu

Sowing  of  crops  at  normal  sowing  of  concerned  crops  viz.;  33  Meteorological Standard Week (MSW) for (Aug 13-19) greengram, 48 th MSW (Nov 26-Dec2) for maize and  15 th MSW  (April  9-15)  for  sunflower  with  100  percent  inorganic  source  of

recommended  nutrients  for  green  gram  (12.5:50:0 kg  NPK  /  ha)  and  sunflower (40:20:20  kg  NPK/  ha)  and  25%  organic  N  alone  and  75  percent  inorganic  source  of nutrient  recommended  to  maize  (135:62.5:  50  kg  NPK/  ha)  for  the  new  tailored cropping system of Greengram -Maize - Sunflower.

## vi) Potential  season  and  sowing  window  for  CoH3  Hybrid  Maize  under  irrigated condition

Sowing of irrigated Maize hybrid CoH3 in the second fortnight of August during Kharif season with integrated application of both organics and inorganic at 50:50 either as blanket (135:625:50 kg NPK/ha) or as soil test based recommendation.

## vii) Potential transplanting window for hybrid rice

Planting  hybrid  rice  CORH2  either  on  26 th September  or  at  3 rd October  as compared    to    planting  in  normal  date  of  planting  of  19 th September  which  is recommended for planting rice variety especially for the variety ADT39.

## viii) Polyethylene film mulch for irrigated groundnut

Spreading  of  seven  micron  thickness  black  polyethylene  film  as  mulch  to irrigated  groundnut  along  with  pre-plant  incorporation  of  fluchloralin  @  1.0  kg  ai/ha under flat bed system.

## ix) Forewarning disease incidence in groundnut

Forewarning  model  was  developed  against  late  leaf  spot  and  rust  diseases  in groundnut. The model was validated and the deviation is around 10 percent. The model was developed for both for Aliyarnagar (mountain climate) and Vridhachalam (Marine climate) domain.

## 7. Basic information

## i. Crop - weather studies

Rice grain yield of Kuruvai and Thaladi seasons over 30 years (1961 - 1990) were correlated  with  concerned  weather  data.  Reproductive  stage  was  very  critical  to prevalence  weather  parameters  both  for Kuruvai and Thaladi seasons.  In  addition maturity stage of Kuruvai and Vegetative stage of thaladi season were also critical to weather.

During Thaladi season, correlation study indicated the positive relationship for maximum temperature at vegetative and reproductive stages.

## ii. Management response to seasonal climate forecast in cropping system

Two locations viz. Avinashi and Thiruchengodu were considered for the study. Model  to simulate the yield of crops (Groundnut, Cotton) was done.

The chance of achieving (65%) at least 1000 kg/ha of peanut occur, when the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) phase is positive for April / May. Conversely there is

only  32%  chance  of  achieving  such  a  yield  in  years  when  the  SOI  is  falling.  Similar analysis  was  conducted  for  cotton  and  economic  performance  of  both  systems  was compared on gross margin basis. Results indicate that in positive SOI years, peanuts out performed in cotton in 70 percent of years, but income difference can  still range from Rs.(-)15,000 to (+) 15,000 / ha. However under falling SOI conditions peanut only had minor advantage in 40% of years (up to Rs.3,800/ ha).

## iii. Seasonal rainfall Vs El-Nino

Analyses  of  long  term  average  of  Southwest  monsoon  rainfall  during  El-Nino years revealed  that during El-Nino years, the amount of rainfall found decreased in all the  locations  of  Tamil  Nadu  as  compared  to  normal  rainfall  of  this  season,  except Northeastern  parts  of Tamil  Nadu.  Analyses  of  long term Northeast monsoon rainfall indicate  that during El-Nino years there was increase  in amount  of rainfall than normal in all the locations of Tamil Nadu.

## iv. Tamil years Vs annual rainfall forecast

The annual rainfall of a particular Tamil year in a cycle of 60 years was not the same for the corresponding Tamil years on the forth coming cycle and one can expect an opposite event.

## v. Stars Vs Seasonal rainfall forecast

The  star  Revathi  had  greater  influence  on  rainfall  during  hot  weather  period (March-  May)  while during Southwest monsoon (June - Sept) and Northeast monsoon seasons  (Oct  -  Dec),  stars  Maham  and  Uthiram  respectively  did  influence  seasonal rainfall.

In the monthly analysis at 30% probability,  the star  Uthiram  had influenced  in getting    rainfall  of  &gt;  20mm  during  July  and  November  months.  While  during  other months  the  stars  viz.  Maham,  Pooradam,  Kettai,  Swathi  and  Moolam  showed  their influence to get &lt; 20mm of rainfall.

## vi. Pest and weather relationship  study in cotton

When maximum and minimum temperature got increased, the infestation from American  bollworm  also  got  decreased.  In  contrast,  positive  relationship  existed  for pink  bollworm  for  the  above  weather  parameters.  In  the  case  of  aphid,  maximum temperature, diurnal variation, Relative Temperature Disparity, bright sunshine hours, and wind speed, had  negative  relationship,  while positive correlation was observed for minimum temperature.

## vii. Study on the weather relationship of eriophyid mite in coconut

The maximum temperature had negative correlation with nuts affected in all the varieties  (Tall  (east  coast),  Dwarf  (yellow),  Tall  X  Dwarf,  Orange,  and  Dwarf  X  Tall)  at three months after spathe emergence; where as positive correlation was obtained for maximum temperature one to two months before spathe emergence in respect of Tall (east coast) and Dwarf x  Tall  varieties.  In  general eriophyid mite affected nuts were either  positively  and  negatively  influenced  by  minimum  temperature  and  relative

humidity respectively  (0722  IST  and  1422  IST).  From  the  stepwise  regression  analysis made, one to two months earlier or one to two months after spathe  emergence,  wind speed    had    higher  influence  on  the  nuts  affected  with  mite  irrespective  of  varieties except Tall x Dwarf  .

## viii. Probing the association of lunar phases ' Thithies ' with rainfall at Coimbatore

Based  on  the  interaction  between  earth  and  moon  in  relation    to  sun,  each month  is governed by both new moon and full moon. In between these two, there are fourteen thithies covering  the 14  days interval. A study was undertaken to find out the association  between  rainfall  and  the  different thithies .  Results  revealed  that  the  first eight thithies succeeding new  moon,  and  eight thithies preceding the new moon did relate  to  annual  rainfall  events.  Higher  rainfall  occurred    normally    during    the  eight thithies preceding the new moon as compared to thithies succeeding the new moon. Almost  similar  results  could  be  noticed  for  both  Southwest  and  Northeast  monsoon seasons. Analysis also indicated that towards full moon phase, the thithi Shasthi (sixth phase) is associated with high rainfall while such effect was noticed at Ekadasi (eleventh phase) thithi towards new moon. High intensity  events occurred frequently during new moon phase as compared to full moon phase.

## 8. Medium range weather forecast

In Tamil Nadu, about 55.4 per cent of the arable land depends entirely on rainfall for its crop productions. Since rainfall varies in space and time, there is risk in farming for    dry    land    crop    production.  Proper  understanding  of  the  climate  and  issuing weather forecast based on the dynamic nature of atmosphere would help in multiple ways. Four different weather  forecasts  are  presently made.  They  are  now  casting, short range, medium range and long range.

Among the forecasts, the weather forecast given under medium range seems to serve  the  purpose  of  the  farmers,  since  it  provides  enough  time  to  the  farmers  to change  the  agricultural    operations  based  on  anticipated  weather  change  under  dry land environment.

In  this  context,  a  project  on  the  establishment  of  National  Centre  for  Medium Range Weather Forecast (NCMRWF) and Development of Agro-meteorological service was  approved  by  the  Government  of  India  and  implemented  by  the  Department  of Science  and    Technology    (DST)    in    mission  mode.  Currently  local  weather  forecast based  on  Direct  Model  output  of  General  Circulation  Model  (GCM)  is  prepared  by NCMRWF and  given  to  Agromet  Advisory  Service    units    located    at  different  State Agricultural Universities (SAU)  including  seven  in  Tamil  Nadu,  four  under  TNAU (Coimbatore, Pechiparai, Kovilpatti and Aduthurai) and two under Tamil Nadu Veterinary  and  Animal  Sciences  University  (Chennai  and  Namakkal)  and  one  at Kannivadi (MSSRF). In turn  the  SAU  prepares weather based agro advisory bulletin and communicate  to the farmers  for making  decisions on agricultural activities based on anticipated  weather  change.  The  forecast  covers,  cloud    cover,    rainfall,  wind  speed, wind direction,  maximum  temperature,  and minimum  temperature.  This forecast is

given for four days from Tuesday to Friday and again from Friday to Monday and thus it covers a whole week.

Presently  TNAU  installs  Automatic  Weather  Station  at  block  level  and  once completed, block level weather forecast with agro advisories will be given.

## 9. Seasonal climate forecast

Seasonal climate forecast is being given to all districts of  Tamil  Nadu  through TNAU  Research Stations both for South-west and North-east monsoon seasons with a lead time of 15 days. This forecast contains the seasonal rainfall both in temporal and spatial dimensions.  This  forecast  is  based  on  probability  analysis  made  through Australian  Rainman  Software.  The  inputs  are  location  specific  past  rainfall  data  more than  twenty  one  years  and  real  time  southern  oscillation  index  and  sea  surface temperature.  This  type  of  forecast  is  being  given  from  1999  onwards  and  presently institutionalized by the TNAU. Based  on the verification  of the forecast,  the accuracy goes up to 70  per cent. Since the forecast is given with a lead time the information is highly useful for farm planning and hence it becomes response farming in nature.

## 10. Climate change and crop  production

## a) Model result on Temperature and Rainfall

The results of the projected climate change over Cauvery basin of Tamil Nadu for    A1B    scenario  using  PRECIS  and  RegCM3  regional  climate  models  showed  an increasing  trend    for    maximum  temperature,  minimum  temperature  and  rainfall. Decadal means of maximum and minimum temperatures were generated to understand the variation  more clearly  and the results  revealed  that the increase in maximum temperature in PRECIS was 3.7 C and in RegCM3, it was  3.1 C.  The increase o o in  minimum temperature in PRECIS model  was 4.2 C  and in RegCM3,  it was 3.7 C o o during  the  same  period.  The  increase  in  minimum  temperatures  is  higher    than maximum  temperatures  in both models.

## b) Model result on rice  productivity

The study on the yield of ADT 43 rice over Cauvery Delta Zone as simulated  by Decision  support  System  for  Agricultural  technology  Transfer  (DSSAT)  under  CO2 fertilization, the result had shown that a reduction of 135 Kg ha -1 decade -1 for  PRECIS (Providing Regional Climates for Impact

Studies) model, while there was an increase in yield of24 Kg ha -1 decade -1 for RegCM3 (Regional Climate Model System 3) model, thus indicating the possibility of change in rice yield under climate change scenario.

## c) Impact of Climate change on  crops

Analysis on the maize crop yield indicated reduction in yield by 3.0, 9.3 and 18.3 per cent respectively during 2020, 2050 and 2080 from the current yield levels in the major maize growing districts of Tamil Nadu with increase in minimum  temperature. Sorghum crop yield is expected to decline by 4.5, 11.2 and 18.7 per cent during 2020,

2050  and 2080 from the current yield levels if no management intervention is made in the major  sorghum  growing  districts of Tamil Nadu.  This is due  to nighttime temperature increase.

- d) Adaptation  strategies  developed  under  ClimaRice  project  for  sustaining rice productivity in Cauvery Delta Zone (CDZ) against climate change
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Introduction of System of Rice Intensification (SRI) under non-rainy season
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Introduction of temperature tolerant rice varieties
- GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Seed treatment with bio-fertilizer (Azospirillum), application of blue green alage (BGA) and growing  azolla  as  dual  crop  in  rice.  This  reduces  methane  emission from the rice field
